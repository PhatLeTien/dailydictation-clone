00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.680
Hello. This is 6 Minute

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.960
English from BBC
Learning English.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.880
I'm Neil and I'm Phil.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.080
Oh, what's that awful noise
Phil?

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.280
Sorry, Neil. I was biting my nails.

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:18.680
I know it's a bad
habit.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.280
Urgh! It sounds terrible.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.200
Sorry Neil. Actually.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.200
It's not only you who finds
certain sounds irritating, unpleasant

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.440
or even unbearable.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.640
Whether it's someone biting
their nails,

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.080
rustling a crisp bag or
scraping a knife on a dinner plate,

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:39.320
some everyday sounds have the power
to make us angry or upset

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.520
There's even a name for it:

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.360
'misophonia'
also known as sound rage

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.920
and it's more common than you might
think, according to some estimates

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.000
one person in five is
affected emotionally by the coughing,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.200
slurping, sneezing and
snorting sounds made by the people

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.920
around them.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.960
&nbsp;
In this programme,

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.320
we'll be finding out more about the
medical condition 'misophonia'.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.880
And as usual, we'll be learning
some useful new vocabulary as well.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:09.280
But first,

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.600
I have a question for you, Phil.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.920
According to a recent survey
by the American journal,

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.120
Medical News,

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.120
which of the following did their
readers find the most unpleasant sound?

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.240
Is it a) bicycle brakes

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.520
squeaking, b) nails scraping
a blackboard or c) a baby crying.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.720
Hmmm.... I'll guess it was
squeaky bicycle brakes.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.360
I really hate that!

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.080
OK, Phil. We'll find out the answer
later in the programme.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.240
For people suffering
from misophonia

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.320
the specific sounds which cause
them to become emotionally upset,

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.920
also known
as 'triggers' often involve food

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.600
and eating. Just sitting down
for dinner with their family

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.920
can feel like torture.
&nbsp;

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.440
Olana Tansley-Hancock is

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.920
a British clinical researcher who
also suffers from misophonia.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.880
Here she explains some
of her triggers to BBC

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.920
World Service Programme 'The Food
chain':

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.280
It's just any kind
of inescapable, repetitive noise

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.280
will potentially cause a misophonic-type
response in me, that fight-or-flight.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.960
And, yeah,

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:23.000
it's that immediate, uncontrollable
reaction that you get to the sound

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
that is the most hard to explain
and unusual,

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.080
I think because I don't think
in modern day

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.120
you don't get many instances where
you get a fight-or-flight response.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.880
It's not like we're frequently chased
down by wild animals and

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.960
then to feel those
from pretty innocuous everyday sounds

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.440
is the thing that takes its toll.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:48.080
Certain sounds trigger a fight-or-flight
response in Olana. 'Fight-or-flight' refers

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.920
to the way the human body responds
to stressful or dangerous situations,

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.840
either by physically running away
or staying to deal with the threat.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.120
Normally, these would be
life-threatening dangers,

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.400
things like a fire
or an attacking wild animal.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.480
But for misophonia

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.640
sufferers even 'innocuous'

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.600
or completely harmless
sounds create problems.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.080
That's right. Olana,

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.600
for example, gets disturbed by
helicopters flying in the sky and

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.200
the fact that other people don't seem
too bothered also takes its toll -

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.440
a phrase meaning
'causes suffering or pain'.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.400
So, what does it feel like to actually
experience this kind of stress

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.040
in everyday life?

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.520
Here's Olana again,

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.440
explaining her feelings
to Ruth Alexander,

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.720
presenter of BBC

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:41.200
World Service Programme,
'The Food Chain'.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.440
It's not the same feeling,

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.080
but it's the same response
in terms of the immediacy

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.280
and an inability to control it
as when someone tells you that

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.640
someone close to you has passed away
that feeling of utter sudden reaction.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.720
You can't control it,

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.800
and then it lingers
and carries on for you

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.120
that immediate emotional
response.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.120
Almost like
a shock to the system.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.880
Yeah.

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.920
Olana describes her misophonia,

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.960
as an uncontrollable and sudden
emotional reaction as if finding out

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.800
that a loved one has passed away.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.320
'Passed away' is a polite,
euphemistic way of saying 'died'.

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.040
She also describes it as a 'shock to the
system' - a sudden and unpleasant change.

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.440
Fortunately,
misophonia sufferers have developed

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.160
some tricks to help. Playing background
music can disguise the sound

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.520
of people sipping
and slurping their food and clearly,

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:37.720
honestly, explaining

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:42.040
what the condition is, also helps
people sympathise and understand. But

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.800
But of course,
some sounds simply are disturbing -

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.160
for example, you biting your nails, Phil.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.080
OK, I said I was sorry.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.680
Maybe it's time to reveal the answer
to your question

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.280
Neil, before you get more upset.
You asked me which sound was voted

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.720
the most irritating for readers
of the journal,

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.640
Medical News.
Right. And you guessed

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:07.720
it was bicycle brakes squeaking,
which was the wrong answer

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.440
I'm afraid, Phil.
In fact, nails scraping a blackboard

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.600
was voted the most distressing noise
and I completely agree.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.640
Right, let's recap the vocabulary.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.120
we have learned from this programme
on misophonia,

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:24.440
starting with 'trigger' -
something that causes people to feel

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:26.600
emotional distress or fear.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.280
'Fight-or-flight' refers
to the natural human response

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.800
to a threatening situation
of either running away

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.360
was staying to face the danger.
The adjective

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.960
'innocuous' means completely harmless.
If something 'takes its toll',

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:44.600
it causes suffering, damage or death.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.360
'Passed away' is a polite way
of saying 'died'.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.720
And finally, the phrase a 'shock
to the system' means a sudden

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:57.000
and unpleasant change. Once again
our six minutes are up.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:03.360
and useful vocabulary, here

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.240
Goodbye for now. Goodbye.
