00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.160
Hello. This is 6 Minute English
from BBC Learning English.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.400
I am Neil.
And I'm Beth.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.400
Do the names 'Lion's Mane' or
'Turkey Tail' mean anything to you, Neil?

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.800
Lion's Mane and Turkey Tail?

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.320
Sounds like things you might find
in the zoo.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.480
Oh, good guess, but they are actually
the names of mushrooms. Lion's Mane

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.080
is a white, hairy mushroom found
across Asia and Turkey Tail

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.440
is a brown fan-shaped fungus which
looks a bit like, well... a turkey's tail.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.080
But if you haven't already heard
these names,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.960
you probably will soon,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.520
because these mushrooms
are becoming popular as medicine.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.760
Throughout history,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.800
our ancestors used mushrooms as food,

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.080
but also as medicine for physical
problems and mental illnesses

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.800
like depression.
In the 21st century,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.840
this medicine is being rediscovered
and marketed. Today

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.240
mushrooms are big business.
In 2021

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.320
the global medicinal mushroom market
was valued at 26 billion dollars

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:13.640
and growing.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.800
But, how real are the supposed health
benefits of mushrooms? In this programme,

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.840
we'll be finding out along
with some useful new vocabulary.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.800
But first,

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:29.560
I have a question for you, Beth.
Neither plant nor animal, mushrooms

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.240
are mysterious and amazing things,

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.600
but which of the following statements
about mushrooms is actually true?

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.360
a) most mushrooms are poisonous?
b) some mushrooms can

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.800
fly? or c)
some mushrooms glow in the dark?

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.120
I think some mushrooms glow
in the dark.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.480
OK, Beth. We'll find out if that's
true at the end of the programme.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.120
Scientific researcher Dr.
Emily Leeming has been studying

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.880
the medicinal properties of mushrooms
for King's College London.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.720
She shared her discoveries with
Sheila Dillon presenter of the BBC

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.600
Radio Four programme,
'The Food Chain'.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.120
So, I think these mushrooms are
very much having a moment

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.960
right now. They're kind of labelled
as 'super brain drugs',

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.720
so, things are gonna
potentially help with lessening anxiety,

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.040
improving potentially depression.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.040
It's very much about these mind
benefits that we're seeing the labels

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.240
on the claims getting put out there.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.920
What do you think of those claims?
I think that at the moment

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.760
they seem to be quite overblown.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.400
We don't have as much evidence
on humans at all.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.880
It's very limited.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.680
Dr. Leeming says that right now
medicinal

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.880
mushrooms are having a moment.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.760
If something is having a moment,

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.880
It's very popular or fashionable
at a particular time.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.960
Mushrooms are popular
due to the claims

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.040
about what they can do for example,
reduce depression,

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.720
a claim is a statement
that something is true

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.160
although it cannot be proved
and others might not believe it.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.120
Dr. Leeming thinks some
of the claims made about mushrooms

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.120
are overblown, exaggerated to seem
more significant than they really are.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.000
The problem is that to sell something
as medicine,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.120
you need scientific proof
of its benefits.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.080
You might feel less stressed
after drinking chamomile tea,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.160
but that doesn't mean,

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.480
you can legally call camomile
a medicine,

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.120
even though it has been used
for centuries to help people relax.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:27.120
However, that hasn't discouraged

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.720
many from experimenting,

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.400
especially young people.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.280
Emma Clifford works for
Food Research Organisation Mintel.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.560
Here, she discusses young people's
attitude towards mushrooms for BBC

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.200
Radio Four programme, The
Food Chain:

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.680
Lots of people absolutely
want there to be

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.960
scientific proof for health claims
on food and drink

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.520
because there still is a fair amount
of scepticism, distrust

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.720
and general confusion
around functionality.

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.520
However, I also think that
for many consumers

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.160
the medicinal properties
of certain ingredients,

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.480
based on natural and holistic ancient
wisdom may be just as compelling,

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:10.800
if not more so, than knowledge based
on modern science and clinical trials,

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.520
and I think many people,
young people in particular,

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.120
they're just really intrigued
to give these ingredients a go.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.600
People want

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.520
scientific evidence that what
they are taking is good for them.

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:25.200
But many are also convinced by
ancient wisdom,

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.080
a phrase referring to knowledge,

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:32.040
philosophy and beliefs that existed
before the arrival of Christianity

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:36.360
in Europe. Ancient knowledge about
medicinal plants has been kept alive

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.040
and some trust this wisdom

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.120
more than modern medicine.

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:43.320
Young people are especially prepared
to give mushrooms a go.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.000
If you give something a go,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.600
you try doing something to see
if you like it.

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.040
They are intrigued about mushrooms -

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.920
they find them interesting and want
to know more, which is not surprising,

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.720
given some of the amazing things

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:57.520
mushrooms can do.
I think

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.280
it's time to reveal the answer
to your question, Neil.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.480
I guessed one of the amazing things

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.240
some mushrooms can do is glow
in the dark.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.360
That was, Beth,

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.240
the correct answer.
About eighty species of fungi

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.880
are bioluminescent meaning
they really do glow in the dark.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.880
OK, let's recap the vocabulary

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.920
we've learned in this programme,
starting with 'having a moment' -

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.120
a phrase meaning to be popular
or fashionable at a particular time.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.960
A 'claim' is a statement
that something is true or a fact,

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.600
although it cannot be proved
and others might not believe it.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.240
The adjective 'overblown' means
exaggerated to seem bigger

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.760
or more important than it really is.

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.280
In Britain, the phrase 'ancient wisdom'
describes Pagan knowledge,

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.880
philosophy and beliefs that existed
before Christianity.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.560
If you give something a go,

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.360
you try doing something to see
if you like it.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.480
And finally, when someone is intrigued
by something strange or mysterious.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.120
They're very interested
and want to know more.

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.560
Join us next time for more new,
useful vocabulary here at 6 Minute

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.880
English. Goodbye for now.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.280
Bye.
