00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.880
Hello, this is 6 Minute English
from BBC Learning English.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:13.040
I'm Phil. And I'm Georgie.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:18.840
In the words of a famous 1960s
pop song, breaking up is hard to do.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.720
Divorce - when a married couple who no
longer want to be together separate -

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.640
can be one
of life's toughest experiences.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.160
During the 1990s,

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.920
divorce rates in Europe and America
were the highest in the world,

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.480
with almost half
of all marriages ending in divorce.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.680
But since then,
the trend has reversed, and divorce

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.720
rates in the West have slowed.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.080
Meanwhile, however,

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.480
the number of couples divorcing in
other parts of the world is on the rise.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.480
In this programme,

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.440
we'll be hearing how divorce is
talked about in different countries,

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.040
and as usual, we'll be learning
some useful new vocabulary.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.800
But first,
I have a question for you, Georgie.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.320
In Britain, one day of the year in
particular is known by divorce lawyers

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.520
and relationship counsellors
as 'Divorce Day'.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.320
But which day is it?

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.400
a) Christmas Day?

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.240
b) the first Monday of the new year?

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.040
&nbsp;
or c) Midsummer's Day, the 24th of June?

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.640
I think 'Divorce Day' is
the first Monday of the year.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.120
OK, Georgie, we'll find out
if that's the correct answer

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.040
later in the programme.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.760
Getting married very young
and differences between partners'

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.000
backgrounds or interests are two
common causes for couples to grow apart.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.040
Today, Marina Adshade is a professor
at the University of British Columbia

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.360
who studies the economics of sex
and relationships.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.640
But her life has
a very different beginning,

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.680
as she told BBC World Service
programme, The Global Story.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.840
I married really young.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.320
I had no education.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.880
I married somebody who was older
than me, who had a lot of education,

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.200
and our relationship worked well
for a while.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.720
And then in my late 20s,
I decided to go back to school.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.800
I no longer wanted to be
a stay-at-home mother,

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.000
which was what I was doing in my 20s.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.640
And that change in our situation for us
just became completely unresolvable.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.120
And I think this is true
for a lot of marriages

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.960
because people's situation changes
over their lives.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.320
Maybe they want children,
then maybe they change their minds.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.440
Marina started her married life
as a stay-at-home mum, a woman

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.560
who stays home to take care of the
children and manage the household.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.920
Marina married an older man, and although
their relationship started well,

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.440
over time, they developed different
ideas about what they wanted from life.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.320
Marina and her husband
changed their minds -

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.000
they changed
an earlier decision they had made.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.080
Growing apart is one of the most
frequently given reasons for divorce,

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.000
and eventually Marina
and her husband's problems

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.320
became unresolvable, not able
to be fixed or satisfactorily ended.

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.400
Marina's experience is typical of
someone who finds themself trapped

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.880
in a marriage
that no longer works, yet,

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.120
unfortunately
due to economic or emotional reasons,

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.160
many people stay trapped.

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.200
So, what can be done?

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.240
Now, some countries are looking
to the authorities rather than

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.920
the couple themselves
for a solution.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.320
Here, Lucy Hockings, presenter of
BBC World Service's The Global Story,

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.000
and divorce counsellor Joanna Gosling

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.560
discuss a new strategy
being used in China.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.480
There was an interesting thing
they did in China

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.280
where they introduced this
cooling-off period.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.000
So, the government enforced this.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.080
Does that work when the government
intervenes in a situation like this

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.080
and makes people behave or do things
in a certain way?

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.280
If nothing changes in the dynamic
between two people, being told

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.280
that they've got to cool off
and wait a bit longer,

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.120
I don't think is going to make
them suddenly realise

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.120
that they want to be together.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.000
It might be an idea
for states to invest

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.520
in communication programmes
for these couples,

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.160
because that's invariably
why relationships fall apart.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.640
In response
to rising divorce rates, in 2021

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.400
the Chinese government introduced
a 30 day cooling-off period

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.840
for couples wanting to separate.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.120
A cooling-off period is
a period of time

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.240
in which two groups who are arguing
can try to improve the situation

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.240
before taking further action.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.560
However, it's unusual for governments
to intervene - to become involved -

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:32.200
in people's private lives this way.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.040
Joanna doubts a cooling-off period
will work, especially

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.640
as the main reason for relationships
failing is non-communication.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.040
She says a lack
of communication is invariably

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.120
- or always - the reason for divorce.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.400
On the plus side,

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.120
by communicating openly,
maybe with the professional help

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.840
of a relationship counsellor,
saving a marriage is possible.

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.760
I think it's time you reveal
the answer to your question, Phil.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.040
You asked
about 'Divorce Day' in Britain

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.120
and I guessed it was the first Monday
of the new year.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.120
Good guess Georgie,

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.400
because that's the correct answer.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.520
'Divorce day' is the first Monday
of the year.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.720
OK, let's recap the vocabulary
we've learnt in this programme,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.280
starting with 'stay-at-home mum',
a phrase for a woman who stays home

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:24.200
to care for her children
and manage the household.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.600
If you change your mind,

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:29.560
you change an earlier decision
you made or opinion you had.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.280
If a problem is unresolvable, it cannot
be satisfactorily solved or fixed.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.600
A cooling-off period is
a period of time

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.680
for two people to try
to resolve their differences.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.160
It can also mean
an agreed length of time

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:47.240
in which someone can change their mind
about something they've agreed to buy.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.240
To 'intervene' means to become involved
in a difficult situation

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.720
in order to improve it.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.800
And finally,
the adverb 'invariably' means always.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:01.240
Once again, our six minutes are up,
but remember to join us again next time

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.040
for more trending topics
and useful vocabulary.

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.880
Goodbye for now.
Bye.
