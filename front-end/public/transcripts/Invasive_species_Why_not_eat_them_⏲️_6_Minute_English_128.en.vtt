00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.840
Hello. This is 6 Minute.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.000
English from BBC
Learning English.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.800
I'm Phil.
And I'm Beth.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.960
Today, we're going to be talking
about an interesting approach

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.920
to the problem of invasive species.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.640
When animals or plants are introduced
to new areas, they can be dangerous

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.280
for existing wildlife.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.920
Tell me about it!

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.080
Every time I plant something
in my garden, squirrels dig it up.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.400
I'm getting really fed up with them.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.000
Have you tried eating them?

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.440
Sorry, what?

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.920
Eat the squirrels?

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.880
That's right.

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.320
One of the simplest ways to deal
with invasive species is just to eat them.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.320
In this programme, we'll be hearing
about initiatives in the UK

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.480
and Belize that are trying to get
people to improve things

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.600
using their stomachs.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.360
OK, but before that
I've got a question for you, Phil.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.880
Lionfish are aggressive predators
which hunt over

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.400
50 different varieties of fish.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.440
To help them do this,
their stomachs can expand,

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.320
but by how much?

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.680
Is it, a)

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.600
10 times its original size; b)
30 times or c) 50 times?

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.000
Wow, those numbers all seem
incredibly big.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.360
I mean, it can't be more than ten times,
can it?

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.080
Well, I will reveal the answer later
in the programme.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.080
Before that, let's get back
to your squirrel problem.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.160
There's a restaurant in London
that offers squirrel kebabs.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.040
They specialise in food made
from invasive species.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.400
So if that's not to your taste,

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.440
you could try Japanese knotweed beer.
This invasive plant has caused a lot

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:55.280
of problems in the UK. But just

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.080
why is it so damaging? Host of BBC

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.240
World Service Programme,

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.800
'People Fixing the World',

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.520
Myra Anubi explains.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:09.400
Japanese knotweed is an extremely
invasive plant that arrived in Europe

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:15.200
from Japan over a century ago,
this super weed doesn't just grow fast,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.920
it has root systems that are
so strong and resilient,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.920
that they can withstand molten lava,
choke out surrounding plants

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.320
and cause a lot
of damage to buildings.

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.960
Myra tells us
that Japanese knotweed is 'resilient'.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.960
If something or someone is resilient,

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.560
then it means that it or they
can resist attempts to stop them.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.120
And another word for resist is
'withstand'.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.240
If you can withstand an attack or damage,
then you don't let it affect you.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:52.120
We heard that Japanese knotweed's
roots can withstand lava from a volcano.

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.720
We also heard that
Japanese knotweed can 'choke out'

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.880
other plants. By this,

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.120
we mean that it takes the space
and the resources such as light

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.720
and water that they need to survive.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.160
&nbsp;
And knotweed is not

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:10.800
the only invasive species problem
with a tasty solution. In Belize,

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:15.320
since 2008
lionfish have had a massive impact

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.440
on coral reefs and native wildlife.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.720
They can eat four times as much
as native species.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.520
BBC World Service Programme

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.760
'People Fixing the World'
went to investigate. Here's Marisol

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.600
Amaya talking to Celso

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.920
Sho from Marine Conservation NGO
'Blue Ventures' about attempts

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.120
by the Belizean government
to get people to eat lionfish.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.360
With a big campaign slogan

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.920
'Eat the lion', they
got renowned chefs to prepare it

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.960
in exotic ways to raise awareness
that eating lionfish was

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.280
both tasty
and helping the environment.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.040
We have developed awareness
for the restaurants to purchase it. Then

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:01.640
we had a lot,
of outreach trying to show

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.280
fisheries, the general public, how
to remove the spine,

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.400
then that allows them to actually eat
the meat from the fish.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.560
We heard the Belizean government
asked renowned chefs to prepare

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:18.760
lionfish dishes, 'renowned' means
to be well known for being very good

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:20.080
at something.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:24.200
Celso Sho talked
about outreach work. 'Outreach' is

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.920
where an organisation brings
their work to people

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.320
through events or publicity.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.760
'Fisheries' are
either the businesses that breed and

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:37.120
catch fish to sell
or the places where that happens.

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.960
So, in Belize people are being shown
attractive ways to eat lionfish,

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.360
and speaking of lionfish and eating,

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.280
I think it's time I revealed
the answer to our quiz, Phil.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:51.800
I asked you by how much

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.120
can a lionfish expand
its stomach to eat more.

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.120
And I thought it was 10 times,

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.800
but you were wrong unfortunately.
A lionfish can actually make its

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.200
stomach 30 times bigger -
that might help to explain

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.400
why they are such a danger
to native Belizean fish.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.560
OK, now let's recap the vocabulary
that we've looked at today.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.600
If something is resilient,

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.880
then it's very hard to damage.

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.000
Yes, you could say that

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.240
it could withstand a lot of damage

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.160
- it can cope with it.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.280
If one plant chokes out another,

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:30.800
then it takes away
the resources needed to live.

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.520
If you are renowned for something,

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.560
then you're famous for what you do.

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.120
Outreach is how organisations bring
their work to people.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:46.520
Fisheries are the companies that catch
and sell fish or the places where they do it.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:48.800
That's all we've got time for today.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:53.120
Maybe you might want to see if there
are any invasive species near you

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.160
that you might want to eat.

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.560
See you next time! Bye!
