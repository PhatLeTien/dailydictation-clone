00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.760
Hello, this is 6 Minute
English from BBC

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.440
Learning English. I'm Neil

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.240
&nbsp;
and I'm Phil.
And now that we've done our hellos,

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.280
let's hear some greetings in different
languages from around the world.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.800
But what do these languages have
in common?

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.960
I'm afraid
I don't know what they have in common

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.440
because I don't recognise any
of them.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.440
Well, sadly, the one thing uniting
these languages

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.520
is that they're all endangered.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.800
We often hear
about animals at risk of extinction,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.800
but a recent study by the Australian
National University found that

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.640
out of the world's
seven thousand existing languages,

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.320
half are under threat.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.200
But what can be done
to save languages from dying out.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.520
That's what we'll be discussing
in this programme

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.640
and as usual, we'll be learning
some useful new vocabulary as well.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.040
But first,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.320
I have a question for you,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.600
Phil, and it's about a country
which used to be one

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.920
of the most linguistically rich
places on earth,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.560
Australia. Before European settlers
arrived in the 1800s,

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.600
Australia had
over two hundred languages spoken by

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.360
the native Aboriginal people who had
lived there for thousands of years.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.040
Many Aboriginal
languages were destroyed by

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.480
the brutal laws of the
Australian government at the time.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.360
However, some survived.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.560
So, which of the following Aboriginal
languages is still spoken today

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.240
is it a) Djinang

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.160
b) Alawa

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.160
or c) Gagadu?

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.720
I'll guess it's Djinang.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.560
OK Phil, I'll reveal the answer
later in the programme.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.840
The sad truth is that

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.600
it was no accident that
the Aboriginal languages died out,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.120
given the cruel treatment
of Aboriginal people.

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:06.640
Children were removed
from their mothers

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.240
and sent to schools thousands of miles
away to learn English, and even today

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.480
Aboriginal communities experience
racism and poverty.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.240
Another
aboriginal language,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.720
Barngala, officially died
in 1960

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.960
when its last native speaker,
elder Mooney Davies passed away.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:28.800
But Barngala
has been brought back to life.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.360
And today, it's spoken between parents
and children and even learned in school.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:40.160
So, how did a dead language with
no living speakers come back to life.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.240
The unusual answer involves a dictionary
and a professor of linguistics.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.120
Here's Professor Ghil'ad Zuckerman
telling his story for BBC

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.240
World Service Programme,

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.080
People Fixing The World,

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.520
I had a dictionary, written by

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:04.160
a German Lutheran Christian
missionary in 1844.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.280
His name was Clamor Wilhelm
Schumann, and he wrote the dictionary

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.640
with up to 3500 words,
which is a lot,

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.880
because he wanted to Christianise

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.920
the, in quotation marks, "heathens".

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.120
So, it's a topsy-turvy righting
the wrong of the past by using

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.920
a tool, written for one goal
in order to achieve

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.560
the diametrically opposite goal.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.880
Professor Zuckerman found an
English-to-Barngala dictionary, written

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.440
in 1844 by a German missionary,
a person sent

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.200
to a foreign country to teach their
religion to the people living there.

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:49.000
Christian missionaries used
the dictionary to teach English

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.080
to what they called
Aboriginal "heathens".

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.600
'Heathen' is an old fashioned word for
someone who belongs to no religion

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.360
or to a religion that is not Christianity,
Judaism or Islam.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.440
Professor Zuckerman puts the words
'heathen' in quotation marks.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.800
The phrase 'in quotation marks'
is used to show the actual words,

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:15.080
someone else has written or said

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.240
but here the phrase is used ironically.
Professor Zuckerman

00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:23.040
is questioning the real meaning
of the word 'heathens'.

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.720
He is signalling that he doesn't
think Aboriginals are heathens

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.320
at all - a bit like adding a wink
at the end of a sentence

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.040
so people know you're not serious.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.520
What is ironic is that Professor
Zuckerman used the missionary's

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.480
dictionary,
not to spread Christianity

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.280
and English, but to save an Aboriginal
language from extinction.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.480
So, he calls it

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.440
'topsy-turvy', meaning upside down.

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.040
Professor Zuckerman also says he is
'righting the wrongs of the past'

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:56.920
a phrase which means doing something
to correct

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:00.600
a historical injustice from the past -
in this case,

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.120
the destruction
of Aboriginal language and culture.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.880
Speaking your own language
is about more than communication,

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:11.640
it means knowing your roots
and feeling good about yourself.

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.600
I think it's time you reveal
the answer to your question, Neil.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.240
OK, well Phil,

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.440
you guessed that Djinang was
another living Aboriginal language,

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:23.440
which was the correct answer!

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.360
Right, let's recap the vocabulary

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.640
we've learned
starting with 'missionary'-

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.840
someone sent to spread their religion

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.880
to a foreign country.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:37.920
'Heathen' is an old-fashioned name for
someone who believes in no religion.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.440
The phrase 'in quotation marks' is used
to show the actual words spoken

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.320
or written by someone else.

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.040
It can also be used ironically,
to show scepticism, disagreement

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.640
or belief that a word is misused.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.320
'Topsy-turvy' means upside down
or disorganised.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.400
If you 'right the wrongs of the past',

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.840
you tried to correct

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.080
a historical injustice.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.600
Once again our six minutes are up.
Goodbye for now.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.760
Bye.
