00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.240
Hello. This is Six Minute
English from BBC

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.440
Learning English. I'm Neil.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.000
And I'm Beth.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.440
Maybe the only good thing
about covid

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.880
lockdowns was
the return of wildlife

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.680
to our towns and cities. Birds, foxes
and deer were seen in the streets

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.440
close to people's homes.

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.240
Of course, rubbing shoulders with animals,
spending time with them,

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.320
is amazing, but imagine a hungry African
elephant stumbling

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.320
into your garden
and eating your prize vegetables.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:38.880
How would you stop it?

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.680
It sounds unlikely,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.600
but that's exactly the problem
faced by farmers in Africa.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.520
Yes, as human populations increase,
while natural habitats decline,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.720
people and animals are
increasingly being forced to compete

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.520
for space. Wild animals
can endanger humans

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.320
when they break into their farms
for food or water

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.200
and people might be forced to attack
or even kill these animals

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.080
to defend their homes.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.920
This situation, known as 'human-wildlife
conflict' is becoming more frequent,

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.760
but in this programme, we'll be hearing
about ingenious farmers in Kenya

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:22.520
who are keeping their food safe from
hungry wild animals and as usual,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.120
we will be learning
some useful new vocabulary.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.120
But first,
I have a question for you, Beth.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:33.560
Weighing around six tonnes a fully grown
African elephant needs to eat a lot

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.760
every day.
But how much exactly? Is it:

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.920
a) 50 kilograms of food per day? b)
100 kilograms of food per day?

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.840
or c) 150 kilograms of food per day?

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.120
Hmm, I'll guess
an elephant eats 150 kilos of food a day.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.840
OK Beth,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.600
we'll find out if that is the right
answer at the end of the programme.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.480
Victor Ndombi is food security officer
for the wildlife charity

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.040
'Save the Elephants'.

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.640
Victor works at Tsavo National Park
in Kenya, where he's often faced

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.360
with wild elephants breaking
into farms for food and water.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.800
Here's Victor explaining more
to Michael Kaloki, reporter for BBC

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.600
World Service Programme
'People Fixing the World'.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.360
The conflict usually varies.
What we experience here

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.800
is during the crop season,
that is the rainy season,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.600
that's where we usually have
the crop raids. The elephants usually

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.200
come here - lots of them
and they crop raid on the crops.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.280
Can I ask you, Victor,
where do these elephants come from?

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.840
So, they come from those private ranches,
national parks and they come

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.920
to this community. They are looking
for where there is green pasture,

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.160
so they come to this community
where we have these nutritious foods.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.360
You know elephants

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.120
love maize, beans
and that is the crop that farmers

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.760
actually farm, so they come
and eat those crops here,

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.360
and also looking for water.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.760
Victor sounds very calm about this,

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.840
it's just a way of life
for the people out here.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.840
But elephants do spell big trouble
for farmers. A fully grown

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.360
male elephant can weigh the same
as six cars on top of each other.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.680
It's easy to see how they can destroy
crops and livelihoods.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.840
Victor works in a national park,

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.440
a large area of land
which is protected by the government

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.400
because of its natural beauty, plants
or animals.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:30.720
He explains that the elephants raid
crops like maize and beans from farmers

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:36.360
in the park. 'To raid' means to suddenly
attack a place and steal from it.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.960
These crop raids
have become more frequent

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:42.400
because elephants are desperate
to find water, and because

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.880
the park lacks money to fix broken
fences, which keep wild animals out.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.000
Victor says
the raids have become a way of life

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.920
an activity that has become
a regular thing in people's lives

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.120
rather than something that happens
only occasionally.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.440
That's no problem

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.760
if it's a fox in your rubbish bin,
but African elephants are as big

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.520
as six cars on top of each other.

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.400
And this spells trouble
for the farmers.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.280
If something spells trouble,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.680
It suggests that
there may be problems in the future.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.720
Fortunately,
there's an unusual solution that has got

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.680
people buzzing: bees.
Ancient Kenyan folklore says

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.960
that elephants are scared of bees.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.600
That's right - elephants,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.000
the world's biggest
land mammal are scared of an insect

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.880
the size of your thumbnail!

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.800
Victor's team install beehive
fences to protect farmers' crops.

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.160
Real bees work best,
but even a recording

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.320
of bees angrily buzzing is enough to
keep the elephants away. Better yet,

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:49.520
the bees also pollinate plants
and even produce honey.

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.360
It's good news for the farmer,

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.680
but I have to feel a little sorry
for the elephants.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.440
Yes, especially because they need
to eat so much.

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.880
I think it's time to reveal
the answer to my question, Beth.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.400
You asked me how much food

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.320
an elephant eats per day
and I guessed it was

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.240
150 kilogrammes.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.600
That
was the correct answer!

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.600
Well done! A fully-grown
African elephant

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.920
needs 150 kilograms
of food per day.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.440
OK, let's recap the rest
of the vocabulary

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:23.440
we have learned in this programme
about 'human-wildlife conflict'

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.120
- a phrase describing harmful encounters
between humans and wild animals.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.720
If you 'rub shoulders'
with someone, you meet them

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.320
and spend time together.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:35.120
'To raid' means
'to suddenly attack' a place

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.400
and steal something.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.880
A 'national park' is a large area

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.600
of a country
which is protected by the government

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:44.800
because of its natural beauty, plants
or animals.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:47.960
If you describe an activity
as 'a way of life',

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.040
you mean that it has become a common
or regular event for someone rather

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.720
than something that happens
only occasionally.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.880
And finally,
when something 'spells trouble',

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.040
it suggests that there may be
problems coming in the future.

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.880
Once again, our six minutes are up.
Goodbye for now!

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.320
Bye!
