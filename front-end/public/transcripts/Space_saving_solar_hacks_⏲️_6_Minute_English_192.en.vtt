00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.760
Hello. This is 6 minute English.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.000
from BBC Learning
English I'm Neil...

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.080
And I'm Beth.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.640
As the world switches from fossil
fuels to renewable sources of energy,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.240
solar panels are appearing in more
and more places and with good reason.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.520
Yes, today, the world is generating

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.960
ten times more solar electricity
than a decade ago.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.360
And what's more solar is the only
energy source on track to meet

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.600
the UN's 2050 net-zero targets.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.480
But there's a problem - space.
As the rooftops in our cities

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.200
and towns get filled up
with solar panels,

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.080
finding space for them
becomes difficult. In this programme,

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:52.280
we'll be exploring two surprising
solar projects to build PV Panels

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.600
in all kinds
of weird and wonderful places.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.840
And as usual, we'll be learning
some useful new vocabulary, too.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.080
Great! But first.
I have a question for you, Beth.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.200
Harnessing the power of the sun
is not new.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.280
In fact, solar power dates back
over two thousand seven hundred years.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.600
In 213 BC mirrors
were used to reflect sunlight back

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:22.240
on to Roman ships attacking the city of
Syracuse, causing them to catch fire.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.480
But which ancient
Greek philosopher was responsible

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.320
for this solar heat ray

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:33.120
Was it a) Archimedes b) Socrates
or c) Pythagoras?

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.920
I think it was Pythagoras.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.120
OK, Beth, I'll reveal the answer
later in the programme.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.640
Our first surprising solar project
takes place in one of

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.120
the world's biggest car parks owned by
US supermarket giant Walmart.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.680
Joshua Pearce, a researcher
at Western University in Ontario,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.120
Canada wants Walmart to introduce
solar canopies in all their car parks.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:03.240
A canopy is a cover fixed over something
to provide shelter or decoration.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.640
Joshua's canopies protect customers'
cars from the sun and rain

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.720
while the solar panels fixed
on top generate electricity.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.320
This electricity can be used by the
supermarkets or given to customers

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.440
to charge their
electric car for free.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.320
Here's Myra Anubi presenter of BBC World
Service Programme

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:26.720
'People fixing the world'
discussing Joshua's idea.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.920
Of course, if Walmart or an
equivalent retailer were to do this,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.840
they wouldn't just be paying off their
investment in green electricity.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.320
They would be adding hundreds of
thousands of electric charging points

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.200
across the US, which would make
switching to electric vehicles

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.800
more enticing for American drivers.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.120
So we're starting to see
more and more of these occur.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:48.640
I think in the very near future,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.360
we're going to see
an enourmous increase.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.000
Solar canopies provide
free charging points,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.600
making electric cars a cheaper, more
enticing option for American drivers.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.040
If something is enticing,

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.640
it's attractive because it
offers advantages or pleasures.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.000
Joshua hopes we'll see more solar canopies
in the near future -  at some time very soon.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.160
Our second surprising solar project is quite
literally out of this world.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.920
Martin Soltau is founder of Space Solar,
a company planning to build solar panels

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.800
22,000 miles away in outer
space with no night or changing seasons,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.520
it is believed that
solar panels in space would generate

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:34.360
thirteen times as much electricity
as on earth.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:40.440
Martin's plans sound like science fiction
and haven't been tried out yet,

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.120
but the idea
of solar power from space

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.360
has existed since the 1960s,
as Martin explained to

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.000
BBC World Service Programme,
'People fixing the world'.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.240
And then in really, the late sixties,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.320
the American scientist Peter Glazier
designed the first practical,

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.680
technically practical, system.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.520
And after that, NASA studied it on
and off right through the decades and

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.520
so it's really only in the
last six or seven years

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.480
that it's actually now
become economically feasible.

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.960
And so the whole cost of
getting things into space has tumbled

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.720
by over ninety percent.

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.520
NASA has studied the idea

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:23.520
of putting solar panels in space
on and off, meaning occasionally,

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.160
or from time to time
since the 1960s.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.800
Recently, the costs of travelling to
space have tumbled - decreased quickly

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.480
and in a short time,

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.480
making Martin's idea for space solar panels
economically feasible.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.960
If a business plan is
economically feasible,

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.360
The economic advantages achieved
are greater than the economic costs.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.440
It seems that a good idea
is a good idea

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.680
whether it's thousands of years ago
or in the near future,

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.240
with that it is time to reveal
the answer to my question.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.760
Yes, you asked me

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:01.120
which famous ancient Greek philosopher,
used the power of the sun

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.240
to destroy enemy Roman ships
in 213 BC.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.200
I said it was
Pythagoras.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.560
Which was...

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.680
I'm afraid to say,

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.520
the wrong answer Beth.

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.960
It was actually

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:15.360
Archimedes, who used parabolic
mirrors to burn

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.080
the enemy's wooden ships at Syracuse,

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:22.280
a trick which schoolchildren still do
today using a magnifying glass

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.000
and sun beams to make fire.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.720
Right, let's recap the vocabulary

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:30.800
we've learned from this programme,
starting with 'canopy', a cover

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.040
that's fixed over an object
to shelter or decorate it.

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.800
The adjective 'enticing' means attractive
because of the advantages or benefits

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.640
it offers

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.080
'In the near future' means very soon.

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:47.000
&nbsp;
The phrase 'on and off' means occasionally,
or from time to time.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.520
If the cost or price

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.160
of something has 'tumbled', it's
decreased quickly in a short time.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.200
And finally, if a business plan is
'economically feasible'.

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.920
The economic advantages achieved will
be greater than the economic costs.

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:04.880
Once again, our six minutes are up.
Goodbye, for now.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.720
Bye!
&nbsp;
