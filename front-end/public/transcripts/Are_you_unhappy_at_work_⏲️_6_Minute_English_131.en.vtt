00:00:07.132 --> 00:00:08.342
Hello. This is
Six Minute English

00:00:08.342 --> 00:00:10.219
from
BBC Learning English.

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:12.179
I'm Neil.
And I'm Beth.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.350
Have you ever had a horrible boss,
not been paid enough

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.562
or simply got tired of doing the same
old boring jobs?

00:00:20.562 --> 00:00:22.606
I love presenting Six Minute

00:00:22.606 --> 00:00:24.066
English, of course, but

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:27.778
some of my previous jobs
have been pretty awful, Neil.

00:00:27.778 --> 00:00:29.613
When I waitressed in cafes,

00:00:29.613 --> 00:00:31.949
I was on my feet ten hours a day.

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.325
It was exhausting!

00:00:33.325 --> 00:00:36.703
Most people have
had bad work experiences

00:00:36.703 --> 00:00:39.248
at one time or another.
Maybe a job

00:00:39.248 --> 00:00:43.043
that was boring, badly paid
or just working too much

00:00:43.043 --> 00:00:47.297
and getting burned out –
lacking energy or enthusiasm

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:49.049
because of working too hard.

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:51.593
But does it have
to be like this?

00:00:51.593 --> 00:00:55.013
Since most of our waking
day is spent at work,

00:00:55.013 --> 00:00:59.101
how can we make sure
our job doesn't make us unhappy?

00:00:59.101 --> 00:01:01.353
That's what we'll be discussing
in this programme

00:01:01.353 --> 00:01:03.063
and, as usual,
we'll be learning

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:05.607
&nbsp;
some useful new
vocabulary as well.

00:01:05.607 --> 00:01:07.150
Sounds good,
Beth, but first

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.362
I have a question for you.
The worst job

00:01:10.362 --> 00:01:12.447
I ever had was the summer

00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:17.744
I spent working as a portable
toilet cleaner at music festivals.

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:21.373
But, according to a recent survey
by Forbes Magazine,

00:01:21.373 --> 00:01:25.794
what was voted the
worst job in the UK? Was it:

00:01:25.794 --> 00:01:28.505
A. a call centre worker?

00:01:28.505 --> 00:01:31.925
B. a bartender? or
C. a traffic warden?

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:35.595
I think the answer might be
a call centre worker.

00:01:35.595 --> 00:01:39.516
OK, Beth. I'll reveal the answer
later in the programme.

00:01:39.516 --> 00:01:43.145
Now, it's interesting that survey
was carried out in the UK

00:01:43.145 --> 00:01:46.231
because being unhappy
at work could be related

00:01:46.231 --> 00:01:51.987
to the British working culture which
emphasises working at a fast pace.

00:01:51.987 --> 00:01:54.740
Here's Damian Grimshaw,
a professor of Employment

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.076
Studies at King's College London
speaking with BBC

00:01:58.076 --> 00:02:01.246
Radio 4 programme, Analysis.

00:02:01.246 --> 00:02:06.543
Really it's all about pace,
cost efficiencies, meeting targets

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:09.463
and deadlines. So, this is why,
when people do surveys of

00:02:09.463 --> 00:02:12.799
what we call 'work intensity',
so how hard you work

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:15.802
are you driven on pace?, is there a
supervisor breathing down your neck?,

00:02:15.802 --> 00:02:19.097
we score really badly compared
to European countries.

00:02:19.097 --> 00:02:21.516
Compared to some European countries

00:02:21.516 --> 00:02:26.521
British workers have to meet more
targets and deadlines – a time or date

00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:30.400
by which a particular job must be
finished. The pressure to

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.905
work quickly means you might have
your boss breathing down your neck –

00:02:34.905 --> 00:02:38.450
an idiom meaning that
someone is watching you very closely

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.579
and checking everything you do –
not a nice feeling to have at work.

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:47.584
That's right. A good job is
about more than pay and conditions.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:51.046
It's one that uses your talents
and gives you some choice

00:02:51.046 --> 00:02:57.427
over how and when you work.
In 2022, Britain's biggest employer,

00:02:57.427 --> 00:03:03.642
the National Health Service, or NHS,
lost more than 15,000 nurses,

00:03:03.642 --> 00:03:08.438
many quitting because of the long
and inflexible working hours.

00:03:08.438 --> 00:03:10.982
Another sector
with long working hours is

00:03:10.982 --> 00:03:15.946
the construction industry. Low paid,
dirty and physically demanding

00:03:15.946 --> 00:03:21.201
construction workers also risk high
levels of work-related injury.

00:03:21.201 --> 00:03:24.454
Here, Emma Stewart, co-founder
of social business,

00:03:24.454 --> 00:03:28.542
Time Wise, tells BBC's
Radio 4 programme, Analysis,

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:33.171
about her trial project to help
builders enjoy their jobs more.

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:35.882
In the work that
we've done within the

00:03:35.882 --> 00:03:38.802
construction industry,
we have trialled

00:03:38.802 --> 00:03:41.596
what we would call
an output-based way of working,

00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:45.350
which means we shift away
from the sense of presenteeism,

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:46.977
this sense of: you
are paid by the day,

00:03:46.977 --> 00:03:48.687
you are on site
from seven in the morning

00:03:48.687 --> 00:03:51.815
until the last person leaves,
maybe seven in the evening...

00:03:51.815 --> 00:03:55.819
to a task-based way of working, which
means you're going to do five tasks

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:58.447
over the course of this day, when
you've done those tasks,

00:03:58.447 --> 00:04:00.490
and you've done them well,
you can go home,

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:02.701
but we will still pay you the
same amount for the day.

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:05.745
They were able to deliver the
projects that we worked on with them

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:07.456
on time, on budget,

00:04:07.456 --> 00:04:09.791
but, critically, the
feedback from workers was

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:13.253
that work-life balance scores doubled
and they were able to reduce the amount

00:04:13.253 --> 00:04:15.672
of overtime that they did.
It's a win-win.

00:04:15.672 --> 00:04:18.550
Emma describes
the current working

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.847
patterns using the word presenteeism –
staying at work longer than usual

00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:27.559
or going to work when you're ill
to show that you work hard,

00:04:27.559 --> 00:04:30.604
but this isn't an
effective way to work.

00:04:30.604 --> 00:04:35.734
Emma thinks a task-based approach is
better both at getting the job done

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:40.697
and for improving work-life balance –
the amount of time you spend at work,

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:44.409
compared with the amount of time
you spend relaxing with your family

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:47.245
and doing things you enjoy.
In other words,

00:04:47.245 --> 00:04:50.749
flexible working
is a win-win – a situation

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:53.043
that's good for everyone involved.

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:56.004
Maybe more flexible working
would help some of the jobs

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:58.173
I mentioned earlier
in my question, Beth.

00:04:58.173 --> 00:05:01.885
According to a
recent Forbes magazine survey,

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:05.305
what was voted the worst job
in the UK?

00:05:05.305 --> 00:05:07.849
I guessed it was a job
I've done myself –

00:05:07.891 --> 00:05:12.062
working in a call centre.
That was... the correct answer!

00:05:12.062 --> 00:05:16.441
Although I think my summer job
cleaning toilets was even worse.

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:18.485
Right, let's recap the vocabulary

00:05:18.485 --> 00:05:19.903
we've learned from this programme,

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:24.115
starting with burnout – lack
of energy or enthusiasm

00:05:24.115 --> 00:05:27.619
because of working too hard.
A deadline is the time

00:05:27.619 --> 00:05:30.539
by which a particular job
must be done.

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.793
If someone is breathing down your
neck, they're watching you very closely

00:05:34.793 --> 00:05:38.588
and checking everything you do.
Presenteeism means staying

00:05:38.588 --> 00:05:42.467
at work longer than usual to show
your employer that you work hard

00:05:42.467 --> 00:05:45.178
and are important to them.
Work-life balance

00:05:45.178 --> 00:05:47.931
is the amount of time
you spend doing your job

00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:51.768
compared with the amount of time
you spend doing things you enjoy.

00:05:51.768 --> 00:05:55.855
And finally, a win-win
is a situation or result

00:05:55.855 --> 00:05:57.899
that is good for everyone.

00:05:57.899 --> 00:06:00.318
Once again,
our six minutes are up.

00:06:00.318 --> 00:06:02.821
Join us again next time,
but for now,

00:06:02.821 --> 00:06:06.116
get back to work!
Goodbye. Bye.
