00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.640
Hello. This is
Six Minute English

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.480
from BBC
Learning English.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.520
I'm Neil.
And I'm Beth.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.320
Names tell us a lot about a person.
Many names have meanings.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.280
Paul, for example,
means humble, and the name

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.520
Anna originated from a
Hebrew word meaning graceful.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.400
Our name is an important part
of our identity.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.120
If you hear someone shout your name
in the street,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.320
you automatically turn to look.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.800
But names also reveal cultural
and family connections which give us

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.800
a sense of our history
and our place in the world.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.360
In this programme, we'll be meeting
a writer whose name combines

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.200
two very different sides
of her identity –

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:51.120
one English and the other Indian.
Sheela Banerjee was born in Hayes,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.520
West London, to parents
from the East Indian state of Bengal.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.760
We'll be hearing about Sheela's research
into her name and family history.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.880
And, as usual,

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.080
we'll be learning some
useful new vocabulary as well.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.120
But first, I have
a question for you, Neil.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.840
As every parent knows,

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.240
choosing your child's name

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.520
isn't easy. Names go in
and out of fashion and a name

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.080
that was popular one year,
soon becomes old fashioned.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.600
So, what was the most popular name
for baby girls in the UK last year?

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:30.360
Was it A. Florence, B. Olivia,
or C. Amelia?

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.120
I guess it was
Olivia.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.000
OK, Neil. We'll find out the answer
later in the programme.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.960
Sheela Banerjee's name came
out of her parents' journey

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.240
from British India to West London
in the 1950s.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.680
Here she tells BBC

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.960
Radio 4 programme,
Word of Mouth,

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.000
how reflecting on this journey
inspired her new book,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.160
What's in a name? which blends her own
life story with history and politics:

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.920
As soon as I started thinking
about it, you know, this name

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.000
Sheela, which is, you know, I was a
7-year-old girl living in Hayes called

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.600
Sheela - this very typical
English name - you know,

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.160
what's that name doing there...

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.840
if you start to pull at that,
the threads lead you to the story of

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.600
my Bengali parents' migration over here,
to mass migration from the colonies

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.640
after the war to this country,

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.200
and then Banerjee contains all
these stories about

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.120
colonialism and caste.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.320
Her parents wanted their daughter
to feel safe in London

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.040
so they gave her
a typical English name,

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.600
Sheela. If something is typical,

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.200
it shows the usual features of
a particular type of person or thing.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.840
It is a good example of that type.
She may have had

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.560
a typical English name,
but with dark skin and hair,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.240
Sheela didn't look
like some people's image

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.080
of a typical English girl. Wanting
to find out more about her culture,

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.160
Sheela started to pull the threads
behind her family story.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:00.920
Pulling the threads is an idiom
meaning to investigate deeper

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.880
into something, revealing
the hidden connections behind it.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.320
What Sheela discovered was a story
of mass migration – periods in history

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.680
when large groups of people move
from one geographical area

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.640
to another. Mass migrations
have happened throughout

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.440
history in the 1950s and 60s.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:25.600
Many South Asian families, including
Sheela's, migrated west to cities in the UK.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.400
But this is just one half
of the story.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.440
Sheela's family name, Banerjee,
reflects her roots

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:34.960
in the Bengali culture of East India,
where surnames

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:38.840
tell a lot about a person's
social status or caste.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.080
Here's Sheela explaining
more to BBC

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.600
Radio 4 programme,
Word of Mouth.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.120
It is an Indian name,
but actually it's not my real name.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.440
You've got names like Banerjee,
Mukherjee, Chatterjee, which, you know,

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.160
nowadays people hear over here,
but Banerjee is an anglicised form

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.200
of my original name which
would have been ‘Bandyopadhyay’

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:02.840
and it’s a name that was changed by the
British when they went over there

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.160
because they really basically couldn't
be bothered to pronounce it,

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.640
or couldn't pronounce it,

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.200
and for me it's always
been a very mixed name

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.320
because it signifies that we were,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.760
you know, colonial subjects and so

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.720
it's a tricky name to
be carrying around.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.400
Sheela's surname is
actually pronounced ‘Bandyopadhyay’

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.680
but during colonial times
the name became anglicised –

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.520
it was changed to sound more English.

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.640
This happened a lot:

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:34.200
the surnames Chattopadhyay
became Chatterjee,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.560
and Mukhopadhyay became Mukherjee,

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.240
either because the British rulers
could not pronounce them,

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.120
or because they couldn't be bothered –

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.000
they didn't make the effort.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.080
Sheela feels her anglicised surname
has always been tricky – difficult to use,

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.400
because of the association
with colonialism and oppression.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.280
Ironically, it was London, the
capital of the British Empire, that

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:02.200
in modern times became the destination
for migrants from all over the world.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.840
OK, it's time to reveal the answer
to your question, Beth.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:09.320
What was the most popular
girls' name in 2022?

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:11.280
I guessed it was Olivia...
&nbsp;

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.360
Which was...the correct answer!

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.560
In 2022, Olivia

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:20.600
remained the most popular girls' name
for the sixth year in a row

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.280
and was given to 3,649 baby girls.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.440
OK, let's recap the vocabulary

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.640
from this programme,
starting with typical – containing

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:35.000
the most usual features of
a particular type of person or thing.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.600
If you pull the threads of something,
you investigate it more deeply

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.880
to find the hidden stories behind it.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.920
Mass migration is the historical
movement of large groups of people

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.880
from one place to another.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.720
If something is anglicised, it's changed
to sound or appear English.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.160
If you can't be bothered
to do something,

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.880
you don't make the effort to do it.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.040
And finally, if something is tricky,

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.520
it is difficult to manage
and requires careful use.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.360
Once again,
our six minutes are up.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.520
Goodbye for now.
Bye!
