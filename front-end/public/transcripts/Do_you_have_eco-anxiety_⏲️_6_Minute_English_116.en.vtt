00:00:06.924 --> 00:00:08.300
Hello. This is
Six Minute English

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.260
from BBC Learning English.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.011
I'm Neil.

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:12.262
And I'm Beth.

00:00:12.262 --> 00:00:14.932
Switch on the TV
or read a newspaper and

00:00:14.932 --> 00:00:17.851
it's full of bad news
about the environment.

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:21.897
But climate change is damaging more
than just the planet's health.

00:00:21.897 --> 00:00:23.899
It's affecting human health, too.

00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:27.694
A growing number of people around
the world are experiencing something

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:34.493
psychiatrists are calling eco-anxiety.
Eco-anxiety involves feeling grief,

00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:38.163
guilt, fear or hopelessness
about the future of the planet

00:00:38.163 --> 00:00:40.332
due to climate change.
Of course

00:00:40.332 --> 00:00:42.167
direct victims of
climate change

00:00:42.167 --> 00:00:46.838
suffer most. Flood survivors
experience depression and anxiety

00:00:46.838 --> 00:00:51.218
and people breathing polluted air
are at a higher risk of dementia.

00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:54.972
But according to the Institute
of Psychiatrists, just reading

00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:58.850
about the state of the planet in
the news is causing stress and anxiety.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.521
In this programme
on eco-anxiety

00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:06.817
we'll be learning some useful vocabulary
related to this worrying topic

00:01:06.817 --> 00:01:10.445
and hopefully be hearing some happier
environmental news as well.

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:12.781
I hope so, Neil.
With so much bad news

00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:15.784
it's sometimes hard
to feel optimistic about the future.

00:01:15.784 --> 00:01:18.412
Well, here's a question
about some good climate news

00:01:18.412 --> 00:01:22.582
for a change. In Australia, an animal
thought to be extinct

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:26.169
has been spotted for the first
time in over 50 years,

00:01:26.169 --> 00:01:28.672
but what is the
animal? Is it

00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:32.759
A. a shark , B. a lizard
or C. a parrot?

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.137
Hmm. I'll guess
it's a shark.

00:01:35.137 --> 00:01:38.265
OK, Beth.
I'll reveal the answer later.

00:01:38.265 --> 00:01:40.350
Unsurprisingly,
many of those suffering

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.395
from eco-anxiety are
young people.

00:01:43.395 --> 00:01:46.315
When BBC Radio 4
programme, Woman's Hour,

00:01:46.315 --> 00:01:49.901
spoke with veteran
environmentalist Judy Ling Wong,

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:53.864
they asked her if she was worried
for young people today.

00:01:53.905 --> 00:01:56.700
I have tremendous
compassion for them

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.201
because what a mess

00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:02.539
we have left the world in, our
generation, and the generation before.

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.543
Of course, you know, the science is
so advanced now...very much

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:08.128
in the past, the science would say,

00:02:08.128 --> 00:02:11.631
yes we think, perhaps...we perhaps have
this models...

00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.967
now we have the exact science,

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.511
so it is an absolutely
different ball game...

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:18.430
we actually know what to do now.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.391
It is about getting on with it,
and the young people

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:23.560
are the furthest
ahead in this.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.731
They can see the future as theirs
and they're impassioned

00:02:27.731 --> 00:02:31.985
to do something about it.
Judy feels compassion,

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:35.280
a strong feeling of sympathy for
young people and the wish

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.617
for them not to suffer.
She blames older generations

00:02:38.617 --> 00:02:41.787
and uses the phrase
'what a mess' to emphasise
&nbsp;

00:02:41.787 --> 00:02:45.457
that the planet is in bad shape.
You can use the phrase

00:02:45.457 --> 00:02:49.544
'what a something' to intensify
the thing you're talking about.

00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:52.255
For example, if someone gives you
a birthday present,

00:02:52.255 --> 00:02:54.800
you might say
'What a nice surprise!'

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.885
But Judy is optimistic.

00:02:56.885 --> 00:03:00.806
The science on climate change is
much more accurate than it used to be.

00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:05.852
For example, we know that moving away
from fossil fuels would be a big help.

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:07.979
Science has changed the ball game –

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:12.359
the set of circumstances
that controls how a situation occurs.

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.863
Knowing exactly how to stop climate
change has impassioned young people.

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.658
They feel strongly motivated
to take action.

00:03:19.658 --> 00:03:24.579
And as it turns out, taking action may
be one of the most powerful antidotes

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:28.750
to eco-anxiety. Actually doing
something to combat climate change

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.586
reduces feelings of helplessness.

00:03:31.586 --> 00:03:34.506
Here's Judy Ling Wong again,
speaking with BBC

00:03:34.506 --> 00:03:37.300
Radio 4's
Woman's Hour.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.761
When the Institute
of Psychiatry

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:43.181
published its special issue
on climate anxiety, one of the papers

00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:46.560
pointed out is that if you
can do something about it,

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.229
if you feel part of the
movement to change things,

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:51.940
or to stabilise things,
then you feel much better.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.608
And also, you know, at the moment,

00:03:53.608 --> 00:03:56.111
the government is
trying to reach net zero

00:03:56.111 --> 00:03:58.780
by 2050 and all that,

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.285
and they committed to creating
two million new green jobs.

00:04:03.285 --> 00:04:07.456
Now, if young people
and activists think about this,

00:04:07.456 --> 00:04:09.332
if you have a green job

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:12.502
you're actually dedicating
your entire working life

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:14.713
to building a green
sustainable future,

00:04:14.713 --> 00:04:19.259
and that has a huge effect
on your psychology.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:22.762
Judy urges young people
to join a movement –

00:04:22.762 --> 00:04:26.475
a group of people who
share the same beliefs and ideas.

00:04:26.475 --> 00:04:28.059
Being part of the solution,

00:04:28.059 --> 00:04:32.689
not the problem, helps reduce anxiety
and with new green jobs,

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:34.691
young people can protect
the environment

00:04:34.691 --> 00:04:36.902
their entire working life –

00:04:36.902 --> 00:04:38.612
the period of life spent
in employment

00:04:38.612 --> 00:04:43.784
between leaving school and retirement.
And Judy's hopefulness is shared.

00:04:43.784 --> 00:04:48.163
Recent polls showed that the majority of
people are worried about climate change

00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:50.248
and are prepared to make changes.

00:04:50.248 --> 00:04:52.125
Finally, some good news,

00:04:52.125 --> 00:04:53.793
and speaking of good news,

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:55.879
what was the answer
to your question, Neil?

00:04:55.879 --> 00:05:00.759
I asked which extinct animal has
recently been spotted in Australia.

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.928
You guessed it was a shark,
which was...

00:05:02.928 --> 00:05:06.014
the wrong answer.
Actually, it was a lizard –

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:09.976
the earless grassland dragon,
a native to east Australia

00:05:09.976 --> 00:05:13.813
that was last seen
in the wild in 1969.

00:05:13.813 --> 00:05:15.649
OK, let's recap the vocabulary

00:05:15.649 --> 00:05:18.818
we have learned from
this programme on eco-anxiety,

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:22.906
starting with compassion –
a strong feeling of sympathy

00:05:22.906 --> 00:05:25.825
and the wish for people
not to suffer.

00:05:25.825 --> 00:05:27.786
The phrase 'What a...something'

00:05:27.786 --> 00:05:31.915
is used to intensify the thing
you're talking about. For example.

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:35.544
'What a mess!' or
'What a nice surprise!'.

00:05:35.544 --> 00:05:39.214
The ball game refers to the set
of circumstances that controls

00:05:39.214 --> 00:05:42.592
how a situation happens.
If you're impassioned,

00:05:42.592 --> 00:05:45.345
you're emotionally motivated
to do something.

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:49.849
A movement is a group of people
with the same beliefs, ideas and aims.

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.229
And finally, your working life is the
period of life spent in employment,

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:56.773
between leaving school
and retirement.

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:58.858
Once again,
our six minutes are up.

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:02.237
Join us again next time here
on Six Minute English.

00:06:02.237 --> 00:06:04.489
Goodbye for now.
Bye!
