00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Hello. This is 6 Minute English
from BBC Learning English. I’m Neil.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.440
And I’m Beth. There are some well-known
English expressions that make a link

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.400
between seeing and eating. ‘Your eyes
are bigger than your belly’ means you

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.040
have taken more food than you can
eat; and the saying you eat with

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:31.200
your eyes first means that food seems more
desirable when it looks good on the plate.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:37.560
But seeing isn’t the only sense involved in
tasting food - in fact, it may not even be

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:43.480
the most important. First, you see your favourite
bacon sandwich, then comes its delicious smell,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.280
quickly followed by the crunchy feel
and salty taste as you take a bite.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:55.080
Now scientists are learning more about the
power of another of our senses – sound – and

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:02.160
how it affects our sense of taste. ‘Sonic seasoning’
is the idea that when you hear certain sounds or

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.920
music, they can enhance one flavour or another
in the food you’re eating. In this programme

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.280
we'll be eating with our ears as we investigate
the link between sound and our tastebuds. And,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.760
as usual, we'll be learning some
useful new vocabulary as well.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.680
But first I have a question for you, Beth.
The idea that sounds influence taste might

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.640
seem strange, but the food-processing companies
that produce some of our most familiar food and

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:36.880
drinks have long known that sound equal sales.
In the UK, for example, the chocolate company,

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:44.440
Cadbury, hired the London Contemporary Orchestra
to perform classical music tunes symbolising each

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.960
flavour of their Dairy Milk chocolates. So,
which background sound did whisky-makers,

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.760
Singletons, used to advertise
their scotch whisky? Was it:

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.400
a) jazz music?
b) bagpipes playing? or,

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.960
c) birds tweeting?

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.440
I’ll guess they used some smooth jazz music.

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:10.600
OK, Beth. I'll reveal the answer later in
the programme. Charles Spence is professor of

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:16.960
experimental psychology at Oxford University.
After years studying how our brains process

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.200
information, he believes sound plays a much bigger
role in how we taste our food than we think,

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.960
something he explained to Mike Johnson, presenter
of BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain:

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:35.200
In general how big a contribution do you think
these sounds, and sound generally, actually makes

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.560
to how we perceive food compared to the more
obvious senses, of course, of sight and smell?

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.520
So I think it's much more important than
we realise, and that can start from before

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.120
we’ve put anything into our mouth - it can be this
sound of the sizzle of the steak on the hot plate,

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.760
it can be the gurgle and the sizzle and
the steam of the coffee machine… those are

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.800
all cues that set up expectations
about what we're about to taste.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:06.400
Professor Spence uses onomatopoeia to describe
some sounds. Onomatopoeia is when a word sounds

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:14.200
like what it means, words like 'buzz', ‘zoom’ and
‘whack’. He uses the word sizzle for the hissing

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.560
sound made by frying meat, and describes a
coffee machine using the word gurgle - the

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.280
low pleasant sound liquids make when flowing
quickly through a narrow space. Professor Spence

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.920
thinks that hearing these sounds while eating
psychologically intensifies the flavour of food.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:39.360
But it's not just psychologists… the food industry
has also discovered the selling power of sound.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:45.720
Nowadays restaurants everywhere are carefully
selecting the music they play on their dining-room

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:52.800
playlists. Reporter, Gianna Palmer, visited New
York restaurant, Smashburger, where every song is

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.040
specially chosen by professional music pickers.
Here she interviews one of them, Amy Frishkey,

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.560
head of music design company, Mood Media, for
BBC World Service programme, The Food Chain:

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.640
Music just kind of has the ability to put
you in a different space and a lot of times,

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.920
then your mood could lead to an
impulse buy that you didn't plan on…

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.800
You're having such a good time
eating out, ‘oh, I'll get dessert!’

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.760
Yeah right… I'm really enjoying the music,
I think I'll linger here a bit longer.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.600
Choosing the right dining-room music
not only makes food taste better,

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.840
it puts people in a good mood - something
which might lead to an impulse buy – suddenly

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:36.000
buying something you had not planned
to because you want it when you see it.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
What’s more, a good restaurant
atmosphere encourages customers

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.160
to linger – to stay longer than necessary
because they’re having a good time. Of course,

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.440
the longer customers linger and the more they buy
on impulse, the more money a restaurant makes.

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:53.440
I think it's time you revealed
the answer to your question,

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.960
Neil. You asked me which background
sound drinks company, Singletons,

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.320
used to advertise their whisky. I guessed
it was jazz music… so was I right?

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.440
That was… the wrong answer I'm afraid, Beth.
In fact, Singletons used the sound of birds

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.800
tweeting to sell their whisky - probably
a better idea than using bagpipes! OK,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.560
let's recap the vocabulary we've
learned from this programme on sonic

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.120
seasoning starting with the English
saying, you eat with your eyes first,

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.800
an idiom meaning that when food is
visually appealing, it's more appetizing.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.760
Onomatopoeia is when words sound like what they
mean, for example ‘boom’, ‘whack’ and ‘moo’.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.640
Other examples of onomatopoeia are sizzle
- a hissing sound, and gurgle – the low

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:45.840
pleasant sound a liquid makes when it
flows quickly through a narrow space.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.760
An impulse buy is suddenly buying something that

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.880
you had not planned to because
you want it when you see it.

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.240
And finally the verb to linger means to stay
somewhere longer than necessary because you’re

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:01.240
enjoying yourself. Once again our six
minutes are up. Join us next time for
