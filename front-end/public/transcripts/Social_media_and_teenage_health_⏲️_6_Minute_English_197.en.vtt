00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.960
Hello.
This is Six Minute

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.280
English from BBC

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.920
Learning English. I'm Neil.
Beth?

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.560
What are you doing?
Get off your phone!

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.840
Oh, sorry!
And I'm Beth.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:24.080
Are you addicted to social media?

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.480
It wouldn't be a surprise.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.680
With so many different apps
out there,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.600
Snapchat, TikTok,
and the latest, Threads,

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.760
it's easy to spend a lot more time
on your phone than ever before.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.360
Yes, I don't think I'm addicted,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.640
but I definitely spend more time
on social media than I'd like to.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.520
However, there are plenty
of studies out there looking

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.280
at how social media affects
mental health with some saying

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.640
it can be as addictive as gambling.
Research in the US has found

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.400
that adolescents who spend more than
three hours a day on social media

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.760
have double the risk of developing
depression and anxiety. An adolescent

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.560
is someone aged ten to nineteen,

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.920
between childhood and adulthood.
With that in mind,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:13.680
it's no wonder parents are worried.
To help with this, the US is currently

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.680
in the process of regulating
social media apps for teenagers.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.360
Some scientists think the UK
should do the same.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.560
There has been growing agreement
among health experts about

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.440
the negative chronic health effects
of social media use on teenagers.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.920
They have revealed in surveys that
social media makes them feel worse

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.600
about their body image and
64% of teens have said

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.000
they are regularly exposed to
hate-based content. In this programme,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.600
we'll be discussing how
social media affects teenagers and,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.640
as usual, we'll be learning
some useful new vocabulary as well.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.720
But first
I have a question for you, Beth.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.360
The app Snapchat is a very common way
that teenagers communicate these

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.680
days.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.320
This is
partly because messages

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.560
and photos disappear
after a certain time period.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.720
But what percentage of thirteen to
twenty-four year olds use Snapchat?

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.040
Is it: a) 70%, b) 80% or c) 90%.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.560
Hmm, I'll guess 80%.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.800
OK, Beth. I'll reveal the answer
later in the programme.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.200
A lot of social media platforms, such
as TikTok, work

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.000
by showing and suggesting similar
accounts and content to those

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.280
someone has already searched
for. Professor Devi Sridhar,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.280
the Chair of global public health

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.600
at the University of Edinburgh, thinks
this can be concerning, as she told

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.880
BBC World Service Programme,

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.440
Inside Science. And this

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.560
is worrying, for example,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.000
with young girls and eating disorders,
that they're being fed that

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.640
in an addictive way and the algorithm
saying, 'Oh, they like that content.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.720
We want to keep giving it to them
because it keeps them on their phones

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.320
and I think that's the really vital
message here, of any of these apps,

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.360
is that their revenue comes

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.880
from advertising.
Teenagers are being fed content

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.000
in a way that is addictive.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.360
If you are fed something,

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.960
it means you're given something.
In this case,

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.400
it refers to content, not food.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.880
The content is addictive

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.240
because social media users algorithms.
Algorithms are a complex set of rules

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.720
and calculations that prioritise and
personalise the content a user sees.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.960
But we need to remember that
social media platforms use algorithms

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.760
to keep users on the platforms
for as long as possible

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.600
because their revenue comes from
advertising. Revenue is the money

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.720
a company earns. They're
paid by other companies

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.680
to use the social media space
to promote their products.

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.480
This could be seen as social media
platforms prioritising making money

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.160
over the mental health of users –
a worry for parents.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:57.000
Professor Debbie Sridhar talked
about the challenges

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.680
of having a teenager addicted
to social media on BBC
&nbsp;

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.320
World Service Programme,
Inside Science.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.280
And so I think

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.000
the challenge here, as a parent, listening
to this is what you do about it.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.360
And I think the onus has been put
on parents and concerned adults

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.080
to find solutions on their own.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.840
And that means debates
with your child over

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.200
what are you are on, are you using this,
but it's a losing battle

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.240
because it's their
entire social network.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:22.960
Professor Sridhar says

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.720
that, when it comes to helping
teenagers navigate social media,

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.920
the onus has been put on parents
to find solutions.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.520
The onus means
the responsibility or duty.

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.680
Parents need to be able to challenge
their children when they need

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.360
to, even if this is
a losing battle, a fight

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:46.120
they cannot win as teenagers have
their entire life on social networks.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:49.720
OK Beth. I think it's time
I reveal the answer to my question.

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.440
I asked you

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:54.680
what percentage of thirteen to
twenty-four year olds use Snapchat.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.240
And I said it was 80%.
And that was,

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.080
I'm sorry to say, the wrong answer.
Actually 90%

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.920
of people aged between thirteen
and twenty four

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.600
use Snapchat –
quite a lot.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.600
OK, let's recap the vocabulary

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.760
we have learned from this programme,
starting with adolescent –

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:18.360
a person aged ten to nineteen,
between childhood and adulthood.

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.000
If you are fed content,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.240
you are given content.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:26.840
This is what the social media platform
offers you automatically rather than

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.480
what you search for yourself.
Algorithms are a complex set of rules

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.400
and calculations that prioritise
and personalise the content a user

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.960
sees. Revenue
is the money

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:43.880
a company earns which could come
from sales or advertising. If the

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:45.400
onus is on someone,

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.600
it's their responsibility or duty.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.960
And finally,
a losing battle is a fight

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.360
you cannot win. Once again

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.040
our six minutes are up.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.240
Join us again soon for more
useful vocabulary here at Six Minute

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.840
English. Goodbye
for now. Bye.
