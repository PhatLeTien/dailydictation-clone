00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.520
Hello. This is 6 minute English
from BBC Learning English.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.440
I'm Neil
and I'm Beth.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.760
There's a famous English saying
'a friend in need is a friend indeed'.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.560
And it's true - everyone needs friends
to share life's ups and downs.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.040
Do you have many friends, Neil?

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.400
Yes, I have some close friends,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.000
but maybe not as many as I'd like.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.480
That's interesting because often it's women
who have many friends

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.160
while men find it harder to maintain
strong friendships,

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.400
especially as they get older.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.960
In fact, according
to one recent survey

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.440
only twenty seven percent
of British men say they have

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.600
at least six close friends.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.680
So, is it true that men find
it difficult to make friends?

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.920
We'll be hearing from
Max Dickens, author of a book

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.440
on male friendship called Billy No-
Mates and as usual, we'll be learning

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.720
some useful new vocabulary as well.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.480
But first, I have a question for you.

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.040
We know that close friends are
important not just for having fun,

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.680
but for good mental health as well.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.000
So, according to research
by Oxford University's Institute

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.280
of cognitive anthropology,

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.000
how many close friends
do we need for our mental wellbeing?

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.440
Is it a) five b) ten or c) twenty?

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.600
I'll say we need
at least five close friends.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.880
OK, Neil, I'll reveal the answer
at the end of the programme.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.520
Now, however many friends you have,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.760
It's a stereotype
that women are better than men

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.200
at making and keeping close friends.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.800
Here's Claudia Hammond outlining
the problem for BBC Radio four programme

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.360
'All in the mind'.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.520
Now, when times are tough, friends are
often the people who get us through,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.000
who are there to listen,
to reassure, maybe to advise us,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.640
if that's what we want.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.440
So, why do we sometimes find it hard
to make friends or that the friends

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.600
we used to have seemed
to have somehow drifted away.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:15.320
Now, there is an idea that women are much
better at maintaining their friendships

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.000
and that men are more likely to hang
out with whoever is around rather

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.080
than to nurture those relationships

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.640
and we were wondering whether
this was really true or is that

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.120
just a stereotype?

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.720
Claudia uses the phrase,

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.600
'times are tough' to describe
a situation of trouble, unhappiness

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.960
or financial difficulty.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.840
Friends help us get through
these difficult periods of life.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.960
The phrasal verb,
'get through' has several meanings,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.120
but here it means managed to live
through an unpleasant period of time.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.440
The problem may be that
your friends have drifted away -

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.320
gradually moved further and further
away until your connection

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.120
with them has broken and it seems
that's especially true for men.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.200
That's right. When author Max Dickens
was getting married,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.400
he realised he didn't have
any close male friends

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.600
he could ask to be his best man -

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.520
the person who helps the groom
at a wedding.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.400
This led him to write
the book, Billy No-Mates,

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.760
looking at why he
didn't have any close male friends.

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.160
Here's Claudia Hammond again,

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.000
talking with Max for BBC Radio
four programme,'All in the mind'.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.520
Max, it's interesting
that you kind of went public on this

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.400
if you like. You know, your book
is even called 'Billy

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.840
No-Mates', the very thing, you know,
that a lot of us would dread being.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.360
It can't have been easy to decide
to say this publicly in a way.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.600
No, it's a real double-edged
sword being the face

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.360
of a book called 'Billy No-mates',
I've got to say.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.040
But I think, so, loneliness
doesn't look like me.

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.000
I'm in my early to mid-thirties.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.480
I'm pretty outgoing.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.440
I'm quick to buy my round.

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.320
It shouldn't look like me

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.400
but, increasingly, it does. So, loneliness,
isn't just the elderly anymore,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.520
it's younger people.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:03.080
Max called his book, 'Billy No-Mates' -
slang for a person with no friends.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.080
It's a memorable book title,

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.560
but Max says being the public face
of a book called

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.800
'Billy No-Mates' is a double edged sword.

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.120
Something with unfavourable as well
as favourable consequences.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.560
In fact, Max doesn't look
like someone with no friends.

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.280
He's young, generous and outgoing -

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.920
an adjective describing someone who's
friendly and enjoys meeting people.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.640
But, increasingly loneliness
is affecting younger men,

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.640
thanks partly to social media,
which can make it seem

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.600
as though everyone is having a great
time with their mates except you.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.040
Max thinks the answer is getting out
and meeting people in third spaces.

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.280
Places like sports clubs or reading
groups which are separate from either

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.480
home or work.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.800
All of which helps get closer

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.680
to the magical number of friends
needed for good mental health.

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:59.120
I think it's time you revealed
the answer to your question, Beth.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.760
Yes, I asked how
many close friends.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.440
We need for our mental wellbeing.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.400
You said it was five,
which was the correct answer.

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.920
According to Oxford University's
Professor Robin Dunbar,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:16.480
we need a core,
circle of five close friends,

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:19.720
plus a wider support network
of about ten,

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.520
making a total number of fifteen
friends for good mental health.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.800
OK, let's recap the vocabulary

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.240
from the programme,
starting with the phrase.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.360
'Times are tough', which describes
periods of trouble or difficulty in life

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.000
If you get through something,
you managed to live through

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.120
a difficult situation.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.640
To 'drift away' means to gradually move
further apart from someone until your

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:47.160
relationship with them eventually ends.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.600
'Billy No-Mates' is slang
for someone who has no friends.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.400
A 'double-edged sword'
describes something

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.600
with unfavourable as well
as favourable consequences.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.880
And finally, the adjective 'outgoing'
describes someone who is very friendly

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:03.000
and enjoys talking to people

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.960
Once again, our six minutes are up.

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.400
Good bye for now. Bye.
