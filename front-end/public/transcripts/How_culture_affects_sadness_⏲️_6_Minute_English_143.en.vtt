00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.760
Hello. This is 6 Minute English&nbsp;
from BBC Learning English. I’m Sam.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.320
And I’m Neil. When Helen Russell&nbsp;
was three years old, her new-born

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.600
baby sister died suddenly. Looking&nbsp;
back at that sad time, Helen remembers

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.820
making a big decision – she wanted&nbsp;
to be happy. She became a bestselling

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.960
author and wrote a book called, The&nbsp;
Atlas of Happiness. She got married,

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.340
and even moved to the famously&nbsp;
happy city of Copenhagen in Denmark.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.320
But the sadness Helen felt didn’t&nbsp;
disappear, and the longer she lived abroad,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.220
the more she wondered whether her&nbsp;
feelings were somehow connected to

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.500
being born in England, into a culture&nbsp;
where, traditionally, expressing your

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.120
emotions was discouraged.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.320
In this programme, we’ll be&nbsp;
investigating how the way people express

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.240
sadness is influenced by their&nbsp;
culture, and, as usual, we’ll be

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.880
learning some new, useful vocabulary as well.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:07.020
But first I have a question for&nbsp;
you, Neil. In English there are

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.760
many idioms which describe being&nbsp;
sad, including down in the dumps,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.680
meaning that you feel miserable&nbsp;
and depressed. Also, emotions are

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.420
often associated with colours, for&nbsp;
example you might go red with anger,

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.660
or turn green with envy. But which&nbsp;
colour is associated with sadness? Is it:

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.340
a) yellow? b) blue? or, c) brown?

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.080
I think the answer is blue.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.840
OK, Neil. We’ll find out&nbsp;
the later in the programme.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.740
Around the world, cultures&nbsp;
express emotions very differently.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.300
In Spain, flamenco performers&nbsp;
express their emotions with

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.700
colourful displays of song and dance,&nbsp;
whereas in Japan, crying is considered

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.500
weak and shameful. To discover more&nbsp;
about how British people express their

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.300
feelings, Helen Russell interviewed,&nbsp;
Thomas Dixon, a professor at the Centre

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.680
for the History of Emotion, for BBC&nbsp;
World Service programme, The Documentary:

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.860
The word sad, as you will know, Helen,&nbsp;
literally means sated or full. So,

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.820
its earliest use is in English, it means&nbsp;
being literally fed up, being full of

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.720
something sad or sated means heavy&nbsp;
and full. And then of course we

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.680
have this huge vocabulary of melancholy,&nbsp;
sorrow, grief, depression and

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.900
many, many other terms, and they&nbsp;
all mean slightly different things.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.280
Professor Dixon explains that the&nbsp;
original meaning of the word sad was

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.920
‘full’ or fed up – a phrase which&nbsp;
today means being unhappy, bored or

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.820
tired of something which has been&nbsp;
going on a long time. For example:

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.920
everyone is fed up of Covid.

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.660
But fed up is just one of many words&nbsp;
to describe feelings of sadness,

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.060
each with a slightly different meaning.&nbsp;
One of them is melancholy, a kind

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.540
of intense and thoughtful sadness.&nbsp;
Another is grief - a strong sadness often

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.400
caused by the death of someone you love.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.200
In Irish culture, melancholy is&nbsp;
expressed artistically in poems or songs.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.300
And in other cultures, India for example,&nbsp;
grief can be expressed by professional

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.260
mourners who are paid to cry by the&nbsp;
family of the person who has died.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.700
In England, however, big public&nbsp;
displays of emotion are uncommon.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.620
But according to Professor Dixon&nbsp;
that wasn’t always the case. Here he

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.880
explains to BBC World Service programme,&nbsp;
The Documentary, how it was only

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.920
quite recently, during the time of Queen&nbsp;
Victoria and the British Empire, that

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.980
the English got a reputation for being repressed&nbsp;
- unable to show their true feelings and emotions.

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.320
By and large it's a Victorian, and then&nbsp;
Edwardian, and 20th century characterization.

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:52.680
As you can imagine, it fits with the era&nbsp;
of empire, of white British men going

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.480
around the world conquering it, and having&nbsp;
a stiff upper lip and ruling over the

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:04.320
people… in other parts of the world, and&nbsp;
believing themselves, the white Europeans,

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.040
to be superior… and one sign of&nbsp;
that superiority, and Darwin writes:

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.300
Englishmen rarely caught cry except&nbsp;
under the pressure of the acutest grief.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.360
Professor Dixon says the Victorians who&nbsp;
ran the empire had a stiff upper lip.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:23.460
These men believed they were better than&nbsp;
everyone else, and that to cry was a sign of

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:29.400
weakness. When we cry, our top lip starts&nbsp;
to wobble and so this gave rise to the

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.620
idiom a stiff upper lip, meaning to not&nbsp;
show your feelings when you are upset,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.720
even though it is difficult not to.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.640
Fortunately, most Brits are less repressed&nbsp;
nowadays, but it’s still hard for

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:46.500
some people, especially men, to express&nbsp;
their feelings. Sometimes drinking

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.820
alcohol gives people the courage to say&nbsp;
what they are feeling, but this is not

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.880
so healthy and can even&nbsp;
increase feelings of depression.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.260
It’s talking to someone about your&nbsp;
feelings that can really help, and keep

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.580
away the blues… and in saying that I&nbsp;
think I’ve answered your question, Sam.

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.260
I asked Neil which colour is&nbsp;
often associated with feeling sad.

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.180
And I said it was blue…

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.610
Which was… the correct answer, and it&nbsp;
gives us another idiom about sadness –

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.260
feeling blue. OK, let’s recap the&nbsp;
vocabulary we’ve learned from this programme

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.360
about the emotion of sadness, or in&nbsp;
other words, feeling down in the dumps.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:29.580
If you are fed up of something, you’re&nbsp;
unhappy, bored, or tired of it, especially

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.500
if it’s been happening a long time.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.260
Melancholy is a type of intense and&nbsp;
thoughtful sadness; and grief is a strong

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.840
sadness usually caused by someone’s death

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.300
The adjective repressed means unable to&nbsp;
show your true feelings and emotions.

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:51.600
And finally, the uniquely British idiom,&nbsp;
to keep a stiff upper lip, means not to

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.500
show your feelings when you’re upset,&nbsp;
even though it is difficult not to.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.740
Hiding you feelings definitely won’t make you happy,

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:03.600
but making friends and learning something&nbsp;
new might, so remember to join us

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:06.900
again soon, here at 6 Minute English. Bye for now!

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.440
Bye!
