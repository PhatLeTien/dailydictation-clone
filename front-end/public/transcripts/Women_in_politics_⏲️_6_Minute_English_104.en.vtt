00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.640
Hello. This is 6 Minute

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.560
English from BBC Learning English.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.640
I'm Beth.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.960
And I'm Neil.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.580
Differences between men

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.500
and women have existed forever,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.320
but in modern times imbalances

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.060
in the opportunities for men

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.980
and woman have widened.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.200
One area where this imbalance

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.060
is widest is politics.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.460
When we think of female politicians,

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.440
the names Margaret Thatcher,

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.900
Angela Merkel, Indira Gandhi,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.600
or Jacinda Ardern all come to mind.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.360
But, while women make up over

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.620
half the world's population,

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.220
only 26% of the world's

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.420
politicians are women.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.280
How much of this is because

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.620
of misogyny – hatred and

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.880
prejudice against women?

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.580
It seems that the surprise resignation

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:54.960
of New Zealand's prime minster,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.180
Jacinda Ardern, was partly because

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.860
of the misogynistic abuse

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.560
she received online, so in this

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.940
programme we'll be asking:

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.340
why is life so hard for women

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.560
in politics? And, of course, we'll

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.060
be learning some useful new

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.140
vocabulary as well.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.460
But before that,

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.380
I have a question for you, Neil.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.960
Britain has had three female

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.820
prime ministers, all from the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.600
Conservative party.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.880
First was Margaret Thatcher,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.560
who was followed in 2016

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.720
by Theresa May, and after that

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.820
by Liz Truss, who resigned

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.160
after only a short time in office.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.980
But for how long, exactly, was

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.500
Liz Truss prime minister? Was it:

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.180
a) 45 days?

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.960
b) 1 year and 45 days? or,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.180
c) 2 years and 45 days?

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.560
I think the answer

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.000
is 45 days.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.680
OK, Neil. I’ll reveal

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.340
the answer later.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.620
One of the biggest barriers

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.480
for female politicians is

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.700
that politics has traditionally been

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.080
seen as a man's world.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.540
When Margaret Thatcher became prime

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.240
minister in 1979, she had to

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.100
manage a group of men who were

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.540
not used to being told what

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.580
to do by a woman. Here,

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.140
Professor Rosie Campbell,

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.240
Director of the Global Institute

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.440
for Women's Leadership,

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.380
explains to BBC World Service programme,

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.260
The Real Story, how Mrs Thatcher's

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.760
solution to this problem was

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.380
to appear more masculine.

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:21.240
She was deliberately coached

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.560
to change her voice and

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.580
to behave in a way that

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.340
was more stereotypically masculine,

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.200
at the same time as presenting herself,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.700
in terms of her attire,

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.800
in a very feminine way which

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:32.760
really showed the tightrope

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.340
she had to walk in order to seem

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:36.840
strong enough to be the leader,

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.820
but not subverting norms of

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.960
what it is to be a woman.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.120
So I think, you know, whatever

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.620
you might think of Margaret Thatcher,

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:44.940
that was a very challenging

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:46.980
tightrope walk that she had to do.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.140
Margaret Thatcher was coached

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.880
to behave more like a man,

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.220
for example by lowering her voice.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.800
If you are coached, you are

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.300
specially trained in how to

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.100
improve at a particular skill.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.660
At the same time she

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.880
was also advised to appear feminine,

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.800
especially in her attire –

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.240
the clothes she wore.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.740
In trying to present both

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.020
male and female sides of herself,

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.750
Mrs Thatcher walked a tightrope –

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.460
an idiom meaning to be

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.900
in a difficult situation

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.580
that requires carefully

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.720
considered behaviour.

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.040
The point is that none

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.180
of these demands were made

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.220
of the men in Mrs Thatcher's government.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.560
Even today, the way women

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.140
in politics behave or dress is

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.760
commented on and criticised

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.840
far more than men,

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.820
with the result that fewer women

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.380
are willing to expose themselves

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.840
to public scrutiny – a situation

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:38.460
which has only got worse

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:39.300
since the internet,

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.040
and with it, sexist

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.600
and misogynistic abuse

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.680
on social media.

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.660
Paradoxically, it is often

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.740
said that the qualities

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.540
of empathy and understanding

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.880
– often associated with women –

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.860
are most needed in politics today.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.960
According to former prime minister

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.480
Helen Clark, who was New Zealand's

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.520
first female elected leader,

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.860
it's not just that women are more caring

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.360
– they also bring a different

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.320
leadership style,

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.580
as she explained to

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.080
BBC World Service programme,

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.220
The Real Story:

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.920
I think that women are

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.080
known for more collaborative

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.200
styles and politics, less likely

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.640
to be the, you know,

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.260
top down, heavy-handed...

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.060
you know, my way or the highway,

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.840
more open to evidenced debate.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.120
I think it's certainly informed

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.800
the way that that I led.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.600
I think it also informed

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.980
the priorities that I had.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.780
Helen Clark believes women

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.940
leaders are more collaborative –

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.980
they prefer working cooperatively

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.840
with several people to achieve

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.000
a common goal. She contrasts

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.080
this with a stricter,

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.940
more dictatorial leadership style

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:46.560
by using the expression,

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.810
my way or the highway –

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.000
an idiom used as a warning that

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.200
someone will only accept

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.940
their way of doing things.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.520
In fact, adopting such dictatorial

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.960
approaches has been the

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.700
end of many political leaders,

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.920
including Mrs Thatcher and,

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.600
more recently, Liz Truss...

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.100
which brings me back to

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:06.360
my question, Neil –

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.280
how long did Liz Truss last

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.120
as prime minister?

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.460
I guess it was 45 days.

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:12.300
Was I right?

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:14.100
That was... the correct answer!

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.260
Liz Truss was prime minister

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:17.940
for just 45 days,

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.340
the shortest premiership of

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:21.840
any British leader ever,

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.100
male or female.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.860
OK, let's recap the vocabulary

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:26.940
we've learned in this programme

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:28.560
on women in politics,

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.600
starting with misogyny –

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.000
the dislike or hatred of women.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.980
If you are coached in something,

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.780
you are trained or instructed

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:37.980
in how to improve

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.120
that particular skill.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:41.220
Attire means the clothes

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.000
you are wearing.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.740
If you have to walk

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.120
a tightrope, you’re in

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.140
a difficult situation

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.060
that requires careful behaviour.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.040
The adjective collaborative

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.600
involves several people

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.000
working together for a particular purpose.

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.100
And finally, the idiom it's

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.360
my way or the highway

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.400
can be used as a warning

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.900
that someone will only accept

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.820
their own way of doing things.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:04.740
Once again, our six minutes are up.

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:05.400
See you soon!

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.000
Bye!
