00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.800
Hello. This is Six Minute

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.040
English from BBC

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.160
Learning English. I'm

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.960
Neil. And I'm Beth.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:16.000
"Plastic is fantastic."

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.520
This phrase was used a lot
in the 1950s

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.200
when mass-produced
plastic items started to become part

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.240
of our everyday lives.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.800
The following decades saw a revolution
as plastic became

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.720
the most commonly used material
in modern life, found in everything

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:36.760
from cars to furniture to packaging.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.040
Take a quick look around

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.280
and you'll soon see how many
everyday items contain plastic.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.760
But now our love
of plastic is being questioned,

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.760
mostly thanks to climate change and
pollution caused by single use plastics –

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.280
plastic products which are designed
to be used just once

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.720
before being thrown away. 11
million tonnes of plastic waste

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.400
are dumped into our oceans
every year.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.160
It's believed that
single-use plastics make up 40%

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.880
of all plastic pollution
globally. What's more,

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.280
it's not just land and water being
polluted - tiny plastic pieces known

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.960
as microbeads have even been found
inside the human body

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.800
and can be passed from mother
to child through breast milk. And

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.080
because plastic comes
from fossil fuels, the process

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.360
of making it creates problems
at every stage,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.000
from burning coal, to transportation,
to recycling. In this programme,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.680
we'll be asking: is it

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.160
time to live without plastic?
And, as usual,

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.360
we'll be learning
some useful new vocabulary as well.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.240
But first
I have a question for you, Beth.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.480
One reason why plastic
became so popular is that

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.760
it's a very flexible material.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.680
It can be formed
into different shapes,

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.040
making it useful for keeping
food fresh, or holding liquid.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.200
Originally, plastic was invented
to replace the decreasing supply

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.320
of natural materials like metal, wood
and glass. So which items did plastic

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.840
first replace? Was it:

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.880
a. snooker balls b. shopping bags
or c. hairbrushes?

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.360
Hmm, I guess the
first thing to be made

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.600
of plastic was a hairbrush.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.240
OK, Beth, I'll reveal the answer
later in the programme.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.440
Dr Sherri Mason is Professor
of Chemistry at Penn State University

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.240
in the US, and a
specialist in plastic pollution.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:33.160
Her award-winning 2017
research into microplastics

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.160
in rivers led to the US Congress
banning microbeads. Here,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.920
she explains the problem
of plastics to BBC

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.480
World Service Programme, The
Real Story.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.600
Plastic is synthetic and,
as a consequence of that, nature

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:51.680
doesn't really know
what to do with it.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.280
Like, a paper bag that's sitting
on the side of the road –

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.640
it's unsightly, but within weeks

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:58.320
there are organisms in the soil

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.480
they can use that paper bag
as a food source, right...

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.680
They have evolved
to basically chew up that paper bag

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.040
and turn it back into soil,

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.600
turn it back into carbon
and nitrogen and oxygen.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.280
But with regard to plastic,
because it is a synthetic material,

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.360
you don't have that evolution.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.760
There are some organisms
that can use it as a food source,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.560
but they're few and far between,
especially when you're talking

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.320
about water systems, aquatic systems
and the temperatures that exist, and

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.400
so they can't really use it as a food
source so plastic doesn't biodegrade...

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.040
Plastic is a synthetic material,

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.600
meaning that it's made
by combining manmade chemicals,

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.280
instead of existing naturally.

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.560
Natural materials like paper decay
and harmlessly turn back into soil

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.480
– they biodegrade.
But plastic is not like this.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.480
It doesn't decay and get broken down
by microbes and bacteria.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.880
In fact, some plastic-eating microbes
and bacteria do exist,

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.040
but these are few and far between,
they're rare –

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.720
they don't happen very often.
It is the fact that

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.840
plastic doesn't decay
which is responsible for the waste

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.520
we see in the environment. Waste

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:13.880
which is often unsightly, meaning ugly
and unpleasant to

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.400
look at. Fortunately,
help is at hand.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.160
The plastic-eating microbes

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.280
Neil mentioned, especially one called
Rhodococcus ruber,

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.920
have been tested by scientists

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.920
and seemed capable of breaking down
plastic into its basic components.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.480
What's also needed is an emphasis
on reducing plastic production,

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:38.240
especially packaging
and other single-use products, rather

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.760
than simply recycling. Action
like this should help

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.440
plastic achieve its original purpose –
to help preserve, not pollute,

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.120
our natural resources. And speaking
of the origins of plastic, isn't it

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.840
time to reveal the answer
to your question, Neil?

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.880
Right. I asked you

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.560
which object made of natural materials
was the first to be replaced by plastic?

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.800
You said it was a hairbrush which was...
the wrong answer, I'm afraid Beth.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.200
In fact, the first
plastic-moulding machine

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.000
was used in 1872

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.720
to produce snooker balls.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.600
OK, let's recap the vocabulary

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.920
we have learned from this programme,
starting with single-use plastics –

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:21.080
plastic products which are designed
to be used just once,

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.680
before being thrown away.

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:26.320
Microbeads are tiny
plastic particles found in products

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.720
like toothpastes and body scrubs,

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.680
which can enter and pollute rivers,
seas and the human body.

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.680
The adjective
synthetic describes

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.360
a non-natural material
made by combining chemicals.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.280
To biodegrade means to decay naturally
in a way that is not harmful

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:46.400
to the environment.
The phrase few and far between

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.520
means very rare
or not happening very often.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:53.400
And finally, if
something is described as unsightly,

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:57.160
it's ugly and unpleasant to look
at. Once again

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.720
our six minutes are up.

Goodbye!
