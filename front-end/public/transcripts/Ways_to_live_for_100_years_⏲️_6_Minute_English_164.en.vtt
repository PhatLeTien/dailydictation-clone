00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.320
Hello. This is 6 Minute.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.440
English from BBC
Learning English.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.280
I'm Neil. And I'm Beth.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.800
How old are you, Beth?

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.840
That's a very
personal question, Neil!

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:19.160
Sorry. I didn't mean to be rude.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.320
Anyway, at least you're not a centenarian -

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.800
someone who's lived to be
a hundred years old.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.880
Are you saying I look a hundred?

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.000
That's even ruder!
Sorry, Beth.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.440
No, it's just that,

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.680
with advances in modern medicine,

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.200
people are living longer and longer.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.320
There was a time when living
to 100 seemed impossible.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.880
But in 2021,

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.920
The United Nations Population
Division estimated there to be

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.440
over half a million centenarians
worldwide

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.880
and that number is set to rise.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:55.640
So, how do you live to 100?
And what could life be like

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.400
in your twilight years?

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.080
A phrase meaning your old age
or the last years of your life.

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.280
That's what we'll be discussing
in this programme and of course,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.480
we'll be learning
some useful new vocabulary, too.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.200
But first,
I have a question for you, Beth.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.760
In 2022

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.400
The world's oldest certified person
died aged 119,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.880
but which country was she
from? Was it:

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.480
a) Switzerland b) Italy or c) Japan.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:28.400
Hmm, I think the answer is Japan.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.880
OK Beth, we'll find out the answer

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.440
at the end of the programme.
Of all the many factors for long life,

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.640
such as diet, exercise and keeping
active, human relationships are among

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.880
the most important. People

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.160
who are more connected with others and
have warmer relationships, live longer

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:51.320
and stay healthier, and according
to psychiatrist Robert Waldinger,

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.680
talking here with the BBC

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.000
World Service Programme

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.600
'The Inquiry', those relationships
don't necessarily have to be with humans.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.240
Introverts actually find having
a lot of people around stressful,

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.960
so they might only need one or two
close people and that's all they need,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.440
that's all they want.
And that's just fine for them.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.160
So, one size doesn't fit all

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.320
when it comes
to how many relationships

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.160
you need to have a healthy life.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.360
It doesn't have to be done
with another human.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.600
We know that pets provide us
with a great deal of comfort and joy

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.720
and pets can calm us down.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.760
Whether you're a shy introvert
or noisy extrovert,

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.040
what counts is friendship,

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.680
be that with a human or a pet. Different
things work for different people.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.920
So, Dr Waldinger

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.280
says it's not 'one size fits all' - a phrase
meaning something which is suitable

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.120
for everyone or every purpose.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.560
So far, we've mentioned the importance
of diet, exercise and friendship.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.280
But some people want
more radical ways of defying death

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.400
and staying young. Dr Nir Barzilai

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.160
director of the American
Federation for Ageing Research

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.040
has developed three scenarios in his
work with centenarians in the US.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.480
The first scenario, called
Dorian Gray

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.520
after the fictional character
who didn't age

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.320
involves delaying the ageing process.

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.400
Here's doctor Barzilai
explaining more to BBC

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.240
World Service Programme.
'The Inquiry'.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.680
The second scenario is
what we call the 'wolverine'

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.160
or the 'fountain of youth' taking
old people and make them young.

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.880
This is very, very hard.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.440
This will be
the most complex things we can do.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.160
And the third scenario,

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.560
and this is a very exciting scenario,

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:47.640
and we have some evidence that
it works, is the 'Peter Pan' scenario.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.360
Peter Pan, didn't grow
old - the idea that you'll take people

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.720
when they're 20 or 30
and give them a treatment

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.840
every few months or every year and
you'll basically erase their ageing

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.240
and let them age

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.960
very, very slowly,
which also will mean, probably.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.480
that they'll pass
their 115 year,

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.800
maximum potential lifespan.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.840
All Dr Barzilai's treatments are aimed
at extending lifespan, the length

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.400
of time someone is normally expected
to live. His second treatment,

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.920
making someone who is old,

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.760
younger, is called 'the fountain
of youth', a legendary source

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.800
of magical water that keeps

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.960
anyone who drinks it, young forever.
&nbsp;

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.960
Doctor Barzilai's third treatment involves
slowing down the ageing process

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.800
so much that people hardly age at all.
This treatment is called Peter Pan

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:47.120
after the fictional boy who never grew
up and is connected to another idiom,

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.800
'Peter Pan Syndrome',

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.000
which describes an immature person
who has reached adulthood,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.280
but refuses to take on
adult responsibilities.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.840
But which country was the
certified oldest person in the world

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.680
from? That was your question, Neil and
I guessed Japan. But was I right?

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:07.600
You were... correct!

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.480
Kane Tanaka, was born
on the Japanese island of Kyushu.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.760
She lived to 119,
the oldest human ever recorded,

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:21.080
and her secret? Playing chess
eating chocolate and drinking coffee!

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:23.240
OK, let's recap the vocabulary

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.400
we have learned
from this programme about 'centenarians'

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.120
- people aged
100 years or more.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.000
Your 'twilight years' are your old age.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.200
The phrase 'one size fits all' means suitable
for everyone or every purpose.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.080
A 'lifespan' is the length of time
someone is normally expected to live.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.240
The legendary 'fountain of youth'
produces magical water,

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.760
so that anyone who drinks

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.520
it lives forever.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.160
And finally, the phrase

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:57.920
'Peter Pan syndrome' describes an adult
who refuses to grow up. Once again,

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.600
Our 6 minutes are up.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:04.040
Join us again soon for more
useful vocabulary here at 6 minute

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.720
English. Goodbye for now.
Bye!
