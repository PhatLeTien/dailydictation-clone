00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.600
Hello, this is 6 Minute
English from BBC Learning English

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.240
I'm Neil and I'm Beth.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.400
Now, you might know them
as aliens, UFOs,

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.280
little green men or even UAPs.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.920
UAP stands
for unidentified anomalous phenomena

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.240
and it's the word scientists now use
to describe mysterious things

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.200
not from this world,. So Beth,

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.560
how would you feel if you looked up
and saw strange objects glowing

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.320
and twisting through the sky.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.520
Wow!

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.040
Well, I might stare for a bit.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.000
I don't know if I'd believe
what I was seeing

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.360
and I guess I'd be a bit scared.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.280
Well, that situation is exactly what

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.360
navy pilots caught
on their fighter jet cameras

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.760
on a training flight
in 2004.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.360
They recorded mysterious oval objects
flying at 24,000 metres.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.520
The footage is known
as the 'tic tac' videos

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.480
and they have had millions
of views on Youtube.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.240
Now, these videos are being reviewed
by US Congress to try to understand

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.280
what these objects were.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.160
Were they flying saucers -

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.560
the disc shaped craft
flown by aliens?

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.600
Or is there
a more rational explanation?

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.360
In this programme, we'll be discussing
whether we are alone in the universe

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.160
and as usual, we'll be learning
some useful new vocabulary as well.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.040
But first, I have a question for you Beth.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.920
Thousands of UFO sightings
are recorded every year.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.400
But which country has had the
highest number of reported sightings

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.040
since records began,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.600
according to the National UFO
Reporting Centre? Is it:

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.480
a) the USA

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.840
b) Canada or c) China?

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.720
Hmm, I think it must be the USA.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.080
OK Beth, I'll reveal the answer
later in the programme.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.920
Now, while astronomers are scientists
who study questions concerning things

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.400
outside of earth,

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.480
they often avoid investigating

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.200
supposed aliens.
Adam Frank,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.760
professor of astrophysics
at the University of Rochester,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.960
explains why
the footage in the tic tac videos

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.320
can't give any definitive answers
of alien life to BBC

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.840
World Service Programme,
'The Inquiry'.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.680
Because I don't think
the pilots are lying,

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.560
you know, I think the pilots are being
honest and have a lot of integrity

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.520
about what they say they're seeing.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.880
They're not saying they're aliens -
they're saying they behaved

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.480
in ways that no jet could behave.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.760
But you know,
again, personal testimony -

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.480
you can't do any science with that.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.480
So, what may happen now is we're going
to begin to get us some scientific study

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.240
of this and we'll try
and get a better handle on it.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.040
Adam says the pilots have integrity,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.920
a noun meaning to have honesty
and moral principles.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.160
However, what they saw is based
on personal testimony.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.560
A 'personal testimony' is a story

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.360
or statement of evidence supported
only by a person

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.280
and what they saw, rather than
any external evidence or hard facts.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.920
To find out more about exactly what
the pilot saw, scientific studies

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.320
are being carried out to try and
get a better handle on the situation.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.360
If you 'get a handle
on' something, you understand it

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.520
and are then able to deal with it.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.960
Taking a more scientific approach
to what the pilot saw

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:36.720
the tic tac videos were examined by
a panel put together by NASA.

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:37.920
Here's Adam again,

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.200
discussing the findings on BBC
World Service Programme,

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.520
'The Inquiry'.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.080
At the NASA panel,

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.840
one of the scientists showed
a simple analysis of the video

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.560
that shows the object travelling
seemingly at high speed over the ocean

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.200
and what the NASA scientist showed was
that with a simple analysis

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.560
you can show that that was moving
at forty miles-an-hour.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.160
So certainly nothing
very extra-terrestrial about that.

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.800
The scientists found that

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.120
although it looks like
the object was travelling very fast,

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.280
it was only moving
at forty miles-an-hour,

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.560
which Adam says is not very
extra-terrestrial. Extra-terrestrial means

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.280
'from outside Earth', and is another
word often used to describe aliens.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.040
So, it seems that for now,
scientists will need to find

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:32.240
much more proof to know exactly whether
we're alone in the universe or not.

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:36.560
OK Beth, I think it's time
I revealed the answer to my question.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:41.120
I asked you which country has had
the highest number of reported sightings

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.240
since records began,

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.520
according to the National UFO
Reporting Centre.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.360
And I guessed the USA.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.440
Which was the correct answer,

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.560
there have been over
100,000 reported sightings

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.960
and encounters with UFOs in
the USA since 1947.

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.080
OK, let's recap the vocabulary

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:04.400
we've learned
from this programme, starting

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:13.840
with 'UAP' - an acronym that stands
for 'unidentified anomalous phenomena'

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:14.240
and is another word meaning
alien or UFO.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:20.040
A 'flying saucer' is a disc-shaped
craft supposedly flown by aliens.

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.840
'Integrity' means being honest

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.120
in what you say and

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.720
having moral principles.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.360
'A personal testimony' is a story

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.520
or statement
of evidence supported by a person

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.880
and what they saw, rather
than external evidence or hard facts.

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:37.880
If you 'get a handle
on' something you understand it

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.240
and are able to deal with it.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.120
And finally 'extra-terrestrial' means
from outside Earth

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.360
and is another word
often used to describe aliens.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.600
