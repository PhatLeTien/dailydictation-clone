00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.240
Hello. This is Six Minute

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.440
English from BBC
Learning English.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.320
I'm Neil.
And I'm Beth.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.560
Do you have a bank account,

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.720
Beth or, like my grandparents,

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.120
do you keep your money
under the mattress?

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:22.840
Sure, I have a bank account with one
of the big high street banks.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:28.320
Yes. Me too. But do you know exactly
what your money's being used for?

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.400
Is it helping fight climate change
or polluting the planet?

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.920
Our money doesn't just sit there
in the bank.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.680
It's invested
to fund other businesses,

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.680
some of which are far
from environmentally friendly.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.600
So, do you know if your money is funding
dirty practices like oil drilling?

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.920
No, I don't.
I have to admit I'm very green

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.080
about money, and I don't mean
green as an environmentally friendly,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.520
I mean green as in ignorant
or naive. In this programme,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.320
we'll be discussing ways in which our
money can help protect the environment

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.360
and, as usual, we'll be learning
some useful new vocabulary as well.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.680
Great. But first

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.640
I have a question for you, Beth.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.800
As the climate crisis worsens,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.040
people are making changes
in their lives to help.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.480
For example by driving less
or cycling more.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.280
One of the
most effective things to do is

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.920
be smart about investing your money.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:27.280
So, according to the campaign
Make My Money Matter,

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.280
which of the following is the best
way to fight climate change? Is it:

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.360
A. to stop eating meat, B. to stop
flying or C. to change your pension?

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.760
I'll guess
it's changing your pension.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.800
OK, Beth. I'll reveal the answer
later in the programme. Concerns
&nbsp;

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:48.440
about how banks invest our money
led to the UK's first
&nbsp;

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.440
environmentally sustainable bank,
Triodos, which opened in Bristol in 2012.

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.280
John Fleetwood, who has worked
in sustainable investing for decades,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.000
thinks public interest in ethical banks
has ballooned in the last few years,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.280
as he told BBC

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.720
Radio 4 programme,
Costing the Earth.

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.360
You know, it was always viewed,
I think, as a niche thing.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.920
Something for those that had
very clear views on the world,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.080
social views.
That's now broadened hugely

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.560
and there's great concern
about greenwashing.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.800
So, who's jumping on the bandwagon?

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.680
That's a huge concern
amongst investors.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.080
So what I'm doing is to tackle that
and actually to say,

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.640
OK, which are the funds that
are actually making a positive social

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.960
and environmental impact?

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.760
Ethical banks used
to be considered niche –

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.360
interesting or appealing

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.840
only to a small number of people.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.000
But as environmentally responsible
investing increased, banks started jumping

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.400
on the bandwagon, an idiom meaning
to become involved in an activity

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.400
because it's popular, and not

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.280
because you're really interested
in it. As a result,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.200
some banks have been accused
of greenwashing,

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.840
attempting to appear
environmentally friendly

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.440
without actually doing anything
serious to protect the environment.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.520
But remember,

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.680
banks rely on customers' money and
are likely to change their behaviour

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.360
when customers threaten
to take their money elsewhere.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:21.640
This idea inspired British film director
Richard Curtis to start his campaign,

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.720
Make My Money Matter,

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.480
On TV, Richard has raised millions

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.840
of pounds for
the BBC's charity, Comic Relief.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.040
But even he was surprised by
the amount of money saved by doing

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:39.960
one simple thing – moving your pension
to an environmentally-sustainable fund.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.760
And, as Richard told BBC

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.400
Radio 4 programme, Costing
the Earth,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.240
he was even encouraged by former
governor of the Bank of England,

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.600
Mark Carney.
You know,

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:54.000
when I started this, everyone said,
well, you know all the mechanisms

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.520
and all the accounting and all the
transparency isn't quite there yet.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.560
But Mark Carney said
to me, 'go for it',

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.960
because it will be the more
that people become interested,

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.200
the more transparent companies
will have to be, the more examples

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.040
they'll give you of good things that
you're investing in. So that, as it were,

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.280
it will get better

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.720
the more the spotlight is put on

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.600
exactly what an ethical
or sustainable pension is doing.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.960
The more
people demand

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.480
responsible pensions,

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.120
the more banks need
to be transparent,

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.480
meaning open and honest
about their investments.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.840
This in turn puts the spotlight
on how pension funds are being used,

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.120
for example, whether they support
large oil corporations

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:39.280
or renewable energy companies.
To put the spotlight on something

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.640
means to attract attention
to it, usually to share information

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:45.240
about something bad.

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.400
Luckily, the customer
is always right

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.040
and by managing our money

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:52.440
ethically, we can all help
a little. I think

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.080
it's time to reveal the answer
to your question

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.400
about the most effective way to fight
climate change, Neil.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.880
I said it was by
moving your pension into ethical

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.960
investments. Which was...
the correct answer!

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.680
In fact, changing your pension
is thought to be 21 times

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:13.360
more effective than avoiding meat
and stopping flying put together.

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.320
OK, let's recap the vocabulary

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.320
we have learned from this programme
starting with green –

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.120
an adjective with several meanings,
one of which is naive or

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.520
inexperienced. A niche
interest appeals only

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.600
to a small number of people.
Greenwashing

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.600
describes attempts by a business to
seem more environmentally friendly

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:34.680
than they really are.
The idiom

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:38.440
jump on the bandwagon means
become involved in an activity

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:41.080
because it's popular
and likely to succeed,

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.360
not because you're really interested in
it. When a business is transparent,

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.680
it's easy to see how it works
because it's open and honest,

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.240
without hidden secrets.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.920
And finally,
the phrase to put the spotlight

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.920
on something means to
draw attention to it.

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.160
Once again, our six minutes are up.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.360
Join us again soon for more useful
vocabulary here at Six Minute

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.840
English. Bye for now!
Goodbye.
