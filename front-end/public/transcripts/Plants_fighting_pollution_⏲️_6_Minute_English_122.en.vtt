00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.040
Hello. This is 6 Minute English

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.000
from BBC Learning English.
I'm Neil...

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.840
and I'm Beth.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.440
Now, imagine
a field polluted by spilled oil.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.400
Toxic waste has mixed
into the water and chemical fumes

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.560
have overtaken the air, leaving animals
dead and the land unsafe for humans.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.680
Unfortunately, situations like this
are common all over the world.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.800
Cleaning up chemical pollution
is dangerous and expensive

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.000
and mostly involves
highly technological equipment.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.160
But what if there was
a more natural solution?

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.840
Recently, scientists
have been developing a new technique

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.440
for cleaning pollution,
letting plants do the work instead.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.440
Yes, plants like water hyacinths

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.080
have been used to clean rivers by
sucking up oil spilled into the water.

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.320
And researchers
have successfully used fungi

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.640
to break down plastic waste.
In this programme,

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.880
we'll be hearing about plants
that fight pollution and of course,

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.560
we'll be learning
some useful new vocabulary as well.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.400
But first, I have a question for you, Neil.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.920
One word we'll be hearing a lot in this
programme is ‘phytoremediation’ -

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.240
the technique that certain plants
use to remove harmful chemicals

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.000
from polluted environments.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.400
But how do they do this? Is it by using
a) their leaves, b) their roots,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.840
or c) their seeds?

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.600
I think some plants clean up
pollution using their roots.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.000
OK, Neil. We'll find out
the correct answer later.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.480
Phytoremediating plants
are certainly needed

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.080
in one of the most
oil-polluted places on Earth.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.200
The delta of the River Niger
in Nigeria.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.960
Ever since oil,
known by the nickname

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.840
'black gold' was discovered there
in the 1950s,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.960
it's become central
to Nigeria's economy.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.720
But oil spills have devastated
the region's landscape

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.200
and there is mistrust
between local communities

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.360
and the multinational oil companies
working there.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.560
Now, one woman and her plants are
trying to fix the problem. Eucharia Nwaichi

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.120
is a biochemist
from the University of Port Harcourt

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.160
in Nigeria,
She uses phytoremediation to clean

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.680
and protect the region's land and
rivers. Discussing Eucharia’s work,

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.240
are Georgina Rannard

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.600
from the BBC Climate

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.760
news team and Myra Anubi,
presenter of BBC

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.680
World Service Programme,
People Fixing the World.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.720
Eucharia is a specialist in
phytoremediation…

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.200
... that word again.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.920
It basically means plants being used
to clean up contaminated environment, right?

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:42.920
Right.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.560
When I met her recently in London,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.720
she had just won the Maddox prize.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.560
This is a prestigious award
for scientists showing courage

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.800
in the face of hostility.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.960
Now, the Niger Delta is a really dangerous
and challenging place to work in and

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.920
despite personal risk to her safety,

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.280
Eucharia has spent 20 years
teaching communities there,

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.560
how these plants
can suck up toxic oil from the ground

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.720
and bring their land back to life.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.800
Eucharia's work won a prestigious
scientific award. 'Prestigious' means

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.640
admired and well respected.
The award recognised the personal risks

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.960
Kari or takes in her efforts
to bring the land back to life.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.760
If you bring something back to life.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.560
You make it come alive again

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.840
or re animate it after it has died
a big problem for climate scientists

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.680
is being accepted and trusted by
the people living in polluted places,

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.840
but Eucharia has found
a way to work with local communities.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.120
Listen to Georgina Rannard of BBC

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.960
World Service's People Fixing the World,

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.600
who was followed by
Eucharia Nwaichi herself...

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.000
Her success, often comes

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.440
from getting communities
who have deep mistrust of outsiders

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.120
after broken promises from companies
to clean up the oil spills.

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.520
She gets them to trust her

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.400
and then they take ownership
for the restoration of their land.

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.920
And I think Eucharia's magic formula
really relies on diplomacy,

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:06.360
trust and actually charisma,
which is a very important quality.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.080
We have a leadership structure,

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.520
so you have the chief, like
traditional ruler.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.880
You have the women leader.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.240
You have the youth leader.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:17.960
So, you find out who does
and inform them of

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.880
what you want to do.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:25.000
Local people's mistrust of big oil companies
comes from their broken promises.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.480
when they said
they would definitely do something.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:30.800
but then failed to.
Eucharia, on the other hand,

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.680
is trusted because she consults the
community by speaking with local chiefs -

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.360
the rulers or highest ranking leaders
of the tribe.

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:42.560
What's more, Eucharia
has lots of 'charisma'.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.360
This personal characteristic is the
natural ability to attract, influence

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:49.680
and inspire people.
Taken together,

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.160
these make Eucharia's approach
a magic formula -

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.520
a combination of actions

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.000
that is likely to result in success.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.840
It's good to hear a positive environmental
news story for once, isn't it, Neil?

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:05.360
But what's the science behind
what Eucharia is doing?

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.240
How do plants clean up polluted
environments? To find that out

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.560
I need to reveal the answer
to my question.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.640
Right, you asked me how plants
clean up pollution through phytoremediation.

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:24.160
I said it was using their roots.
And that was the correct answer.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.760
OK, it's time to recap vocabulary

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.320
we've learnt from the programme,

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.160
starting with the adjective 'prestigious'
meaning admired and well respected.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:35.120
If you 'bring something back to life'.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.000
you make it come alive again
after being dead.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.200
A 'broken promise' is when you promise

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.840
definitely to do something

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.200
but then fail to do

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.680
what you said you would.
A 'chief' is the ruler of a tribe

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.600
or the most important highest
ranking leader of an organisation.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:55.880
'Charisma' is a special natural ability
to attract, influence and inspire people.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.920
And finally, the phrase 'a magic formula'
describes a combination of actions

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.320
that is likely to result in success.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.120
Once again, our six minutes are up.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.320
Bye for now.
Goodbye.
