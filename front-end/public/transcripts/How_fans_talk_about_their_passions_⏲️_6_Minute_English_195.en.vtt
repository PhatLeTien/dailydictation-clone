00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:09.400
Hello. This
is 6 Minute

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.080
English from BBC

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:12.280
Learning English.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.160
I'm Beth.
And I'm Neil.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.000
If you really love something,

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.360
maybe a sport or a hobby,

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.120
a music band or a TV show,
you might call yourself a fan.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.440
Nowadays, thanks to the internet, fans

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.360
from around the world can meet online
to share their passion

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.400
and this has led to a new word, fandom.
Fandom is more than simply being a fan.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.880
It's a whole culture created by
a community of people

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.600
to share their love
of the same thing.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.040
What's more, fandom has started
to develop its own language.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.280
In this programme, we'll be taking a trip
into the world of fandoms and, as usual,

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.680
we will be learning some new
and useful vocabulary, too.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.720
But before that I have a question
for you, Neil.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.880
The original word 'fan' was first used
about Americans

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.960
in the early 20th century.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.760
But what were
these Americans fans of?

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.800
Was it: a) Hollywood movie stars,
b) baseball or c) Disney cartoons.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.920
I'll guess they were fans
of Disney cartoons.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.240
OK, Neil. We'll find out later
in the programme.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.120
Michael Bond is the author
of a new book, Fans.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.960
Here he discusses the meaning
of fandom with BBC

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.400
Radio 4 programme,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.600
Word of Mouth.
Kings rule

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.720
their kingdoms, fans
certainly rule their fandoms.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.760
It taps into that ancient human impulse to
belong to a group of like-minded people,

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.440
and of course, being a fan by
yourself can be a challenging thing

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.120
because fannish pursuits
can look quirky and odd...

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.360
even obsessive,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.760
and you get often mocked and I mean,
if you're a Jane Austen fan

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.920
and you want to dress up in a bonnet
and gown of the Regency era,

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.440
it's difficult to do that
by yourself in public,

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.400
but once you join a fandom,
there's no problem.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.600
&nbsp;
Fans are groups of like-minded people.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.120
They share similar opinions,
ideas or interests.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.200
They do all kinds of weird
and wonderful things together,

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.840
such as dressing up
as Harry Potter characters - behaviour

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.600
which might be called quirky,
an adjective meaning odd or unusual,

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.600
but in an interesting way.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.360
Unfortunately, this quirky behaviour
also means fans sometimes get mocked.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.600
To mock somebody means to insult them
by laughing at them in an unkind way.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.440
But this hasn't discouraged fans
who have started using new words

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.560
and phrases to show

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.240
they belong to a particular fandom.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.720
Here's Michael Bond again,

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.040
explaining the meaning
of two new words about the behaviour

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.760
of football fans to BBC

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.920
Radio 4 programme,
Word of Mouth.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.640
Academics who study fandoms,

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.240
they love to use acronyms
and abbreviations

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.400
and they've got several phrases which
they use to describe the behaviour

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.680
of football fans...BIRGing so that
means 'Basking in Reflected Glory'.

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.920
When your team wins

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.360
everyone wants a bit of the action,

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.360
you take to the streets, dance around...
and so the antithesis

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:26.240
of that is CORFing which means
'Cutting Off Reflected Failure'

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.840
and that is what people sometimes do
when their team loses

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.240
and they don't want
to be associated with

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.960
that loss, that sense of failure.
&nbsp;

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.200
BIRGing is made of an
acronym of the words,

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.720
Basking in Reflected Glory.

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.120
It means feeling good about yourself
when the football team you support wins.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.840
Fans say,
"WE won!",

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.640
even though it was the players
on the pitch,

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.560
not the fans,
who scored the goal.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.120
When their team wins,

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.720
fans cheer and want a piece
of the action, an idiom meaning

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:05.720
that they take part in celebrations
and other exciting group activities,

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.120
and feel the success of the team
as a personal success.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.520
The opposite of BIRGing
is CORFing, another acronym,

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:14.840
this time of the words,

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.080
Cutting Off Reflected Failure.
CORFING involves distancing yourself

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.440
from the team
you support when they lose.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.600
Instead of saying, "WE won",
you say, "They played rubbish!"

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.520
Of course,
true fans never CORF.

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.200
In fact, some football fans take a
kind of strange pessimistic pleasure

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.360
when their team loses

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.600
week after week.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.040
I can't imagine that's true
of the Americans you mentioned, Beth.

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.560
So, what was the correct answer
to your question?

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.360
I asked who the original word 'fan' was
used to describe. You said it was fans

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.360
of Disney cartoons, which was...

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.520
the wrong answer,

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:00.120
I'm afraid. Actually, it was
baseball fans, or 'fanatics'

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.360
as they were called at the time.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.480
OK, let's recap the vocabulary
we've learnt,

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.240
starting with like-minded - an
adjective describing people who share

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.880
similar opinions, ideas or interests.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.120
Quirky means odd or unusual, but
in an attractive or interesting way.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.360
If you mock someone, you insult
and laugh at them in an unkind way.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.080
BIRGing is short for Basking
in Reflected Glory.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.760
It means feeling good
about yourself when the team

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.480
you support wins.
The opposite of this

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.000
is CORFing, an acronym
of Cutting Off Reflected Failure,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.560
which means distancing yourself from
your favourite team when they lose.

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:47.080
And finally, if you want a piece
or a slice of the action,

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:52.120
you want to take part in a celebration
or other exciting group activity

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:55.240
to include yourself
in a collective success.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.680
Once again,
our six minutes are up.

useful vocabulary here at 6 Minute

English. Bye for now.
Bye!
