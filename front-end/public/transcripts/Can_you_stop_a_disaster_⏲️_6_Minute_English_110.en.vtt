00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.040
Hello. This is Six Minute

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.120
English from BBC Learning English

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.000
I'm Beth
and I am Neil.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.280
Now, depending on how you look at it,

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.840
Roy Sullivan was either the luckiest
or the unluckiest man alive.

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.040
Working as a US park ranger, Roy
was struck by lightning

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:29.520
on seven different occasions
and survived them all.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.360
But Roy isn't the only victim
of an unpredictable natural event,

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.360
sometimes called an act of God.
In the last decade

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.880
an estimated half a million people
have died globally

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.680
in natural disasters such as earthquakes,
tsunamis, hurricanes and cyclones.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:54.320
In 2023 at least sixty thousand people died
after earthquakes in Turkey and Syria

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.560
and things are predicted to get worse
in the future due to climate change

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.760
and increasing populations.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.040
So can anything be done to stop
natural disasters or like Roy Sullivan

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.920
should we accept that some things are
beyond our control? In this programme,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.040
we'll be finding out and, as usual,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.640
we will be learning
some useful new vocabulary, too.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.880
Throughout history,

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.200
floods, when there's too much water,
and droughts, when there isn't enough,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.520
have caused most human deaths,

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.120
but with climate change, new dangers
are emerging. But do you know

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.640
Neil, which natural disaster is
most responsible for human deaths?

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.080
Now,
um,

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.760
I'm not sure
but you do hear a lot

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.960
about terrible earthquakes
in the news, don't you?

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.280
Yeah, probably earthquakes.

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.760
Now, in her job as professor of hazard

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.880
and risk at Durham University,
Lucy Easthope

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.440
attends conferences to advise
on planning for natural emergencies.

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.640
But according to Lucy, describing
disasters as natural is a mistake,

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.920
as she told BBC Radio Four
programme Inside Science.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.240
Probably the worst thing you can do
at a disaster conference

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.880
is describe it as a natural disaster
because that's the hopelessness

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.560
right there. The 'natural' implies
a sense of fatalism and a sense of

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.440
'let's give up now',
whereas in fact, these events...

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:22.560
there's huge elements that we have
in our grasp to both prevent,

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.600
and more importantly
perhaps, prevent additional harm.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.560
Professor Easthope thinks calling
disasters, 'natural' is fatalistic.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.000
It involves the belief that people
are powerless to change events.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.400
Although no one can prevent
an earthquake,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.400
there are ways people can reduce
the damage done - what Professor Easthope

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.680
calls additional harm.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.360
Often, this additional harm,

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.280
things like the spread of diseases

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.560
or destroyed roads and buildings, are
worse than the disaster itself.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.480
Fortunately, ways to limit

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.760
the damage are within our grasp.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.360
If something is within your grasp, it is
very likely that you will achieve it.

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.280
It may be impossible
to stop disasters from happening,

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.800
but there are ways to limit

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.320
the number of deaths. An earthquake
in the middle of the ocean

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.760
is less of a disaster

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.840
than in a populated city.

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.200
So one technological solution
involves computers

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.680
mapping geological
movements to identify places at risk.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.120
But low tech solutions can be
just as effective.

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.400
Bangladesh has seen a hundred-fold
decrease in cyclone deaths

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.760
since the introduction of
its new monitoring and alert system.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.040
Ilan Kelman,

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.920
Professor of disasters and health at
UCL, has been involved in the project

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:47.080
and told BBC Radio Four's
Inside Science, how it worked.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.000
What Bangladesh has done... has realised,
we cannot have

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.320
one hundred thousand people dying
in a cyclone each time.

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.240
So, in addition
to having people on bicycles

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.560
with megaphones going out and saying,
'look a cyclone is coming,

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.600
please get to shelter'. People in the
danger zones have grown up accepting

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.840
that their shelters will be safe,
knowing where the evacuation routes are,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.440
but most importantly, that they
can return afterwards to their homes

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.640
and to their livelihoods because
they've built the infrastructure

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.600
and they've built their jobs in order
to avoid being destroyed by the cyclone.

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:23.200
One low-tech solution

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.040
involves people on bicycles

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.040
shouting warnings about
approaching cyclones into a megaphone,

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.360
a handheld cone-shaped device
that makes your voice louder

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.920
when you speak into it.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:35.520
Once people know the danger,

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.520
they can start the evacuation –
moving people from a dangerous place

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.160
to somewhere safe.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.040
The Bangladeshis have built shelters
which protect everyone:

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.120
children, the old and sick,

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.080
even animals,
so that when the cyclone is over,

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.440
they can safely return
to their livelihoods – their job

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.360
and other activities which give them
the things they need to live.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.240
Well, it's great to see people working
together to survive cyclones.

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.640
Earlier, we were talking
about other natural disasters.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.960
We were and I asked you

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:09.120
which disaster you thought caused

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.080
most deaths and you said you thought
maybe earthquakes which was... the right

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.960
answer, which is why these new ideas
to save lives are so hopeful.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.920
OK, let's recap the vocabulary

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.440
we've learnt from this programme
on natural disasters.

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.320
Unpredictable events or catastrophes
which cannot be controlled by humans

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.360
and which are sometimes called
acts of God.

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:37.040
Fatalism is the belief that people
are powerless to change

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.480
the way things happen.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.360
If something is within your grasp,
it is likely to be accomplished.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.800
A megaphone is a handheld cone-shaped
device that makes your voice louder

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.800
when you speak into it so that
people can hear you from far away.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:54.200
Evacuation means moving people
from a dangerous place

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:55.240
to somewhere safe.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.760
And finally, livelihood is your job
or the work that gives you money

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.360
to buy the things you need to live.
Once again our six minutes are up.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.280
Goodbye, everyone. Bye.
