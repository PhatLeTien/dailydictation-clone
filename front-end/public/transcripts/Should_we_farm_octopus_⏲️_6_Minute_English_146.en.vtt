00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:09.480
Hello. This is Six Minute

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:10.840
English from BBC

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.160
Learning English. I'm Neil.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.360
And I'm Beth.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.480
Beth, what do you think
about when I say the word octopus?

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.880
Well, I know

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.200
they're intelligent, they can change
colour to hide in their surroundings,

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.600
and of course they have eight arms.
But, I have to admit I also think

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.320
about how they taste - delicious.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.360
Yeah, I think that too,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.080
as do plenty of other people. Octopus

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.960
is most commonly eaten in South
Korea, Spain, Portugal and Japan,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.080
where they can't get
enough of that umami

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:51.560
flavour. Umami is one of the five
basic tastes and is a savoury flavour.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.160
Until recently octopus
has only been caught in the wild,

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.760
but now a Spanish
multinational company has announced

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.320
it will be ready
to sell farmed octopus soon,

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.200
which campaigners have described as
ethically and ecologically unjustified.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.880
This is because octopuses are sentient,

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.400
an adjective describing
a thing that experiences

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.400
feelings like pleasure and pain.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.680
Humans and many other animals like pigs,
monkeys and birds are also sentient.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.760
So, is it

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.560
OK to farm octopus

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.360
when they have been shown to experience
feelings? In this programme,

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.600
we'll be discussing whether
farming octopus can ever be ethical

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:35.800
and, as usual,

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.160
we will be learning
some useful new vocabulary as well.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.000
But first

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.160
I have a question for you, Beth.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.240
Octopuses are known
for their ability to problem solve

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.800
and when kept in tanks
have been known to escape.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.160
But where did Inky

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.080
the octopus go when he broke
out of his tank

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.880
at the New Zealand National Aquarium
in 2016?

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.360
Was it a) down a drain
into the Pacific Ocean, b)

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.360
to the tank of a female octopus, or c)
to the aquarium car park.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.920
I'll guess he went to the tank
of a female octopus.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.240
OK, Beth. I'll reveal the answer later
in the programme. In many countries,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.600
it is not easy to find

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.320
octopus in shops,

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.560
but if plans for farmed octopus

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.640
go ahead, you're much more likely
to see it in the supermarket.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.400
Claire Marshall, who has been
reporting on the octopus farm story

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.160
since 2019 explains why

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.960
octopuses have not been farmed
before, as she told BBC

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.960
World Service programme, The Food
Chain.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.160
They've got an incredibly complex
life cycle

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.440
and its, scientists
have been working feverishly

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.440
to try to close that life cycle,
particularly in Mexico and Japan,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.720
and obviously now Spain.

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.160
They need live food -

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:57.800
the larvae. And also octopuses
are incredibly solitary and

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.000
it just makes it really hard to manage
to basically keep them in captivity

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
at a commercial scale.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.640
Octopuses are difficult to farm
because they have a complex life cycle -

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.440
the series of changes
an animal goes through,

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.280
starting with birth and
ending with death.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.200
Unlike traditional farmed animals
like chickens

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.040
and pigs, who are social animals
and can be kept together,

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.520
octopuses are solitary,
meaning they like to live alone.

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.680
This makes keeping them in captivity
very difficult because of space.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.120
If an animal lives in captivity, it's
kept somewhere and not allowed to leave,

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.880
even if it wants to â€“ like in a zoo.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.840
But it's not only space

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:43.760
that is a problem
when it comes to farming octopus.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.320
It's their capacity
to feel emotions as well.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.320
Scientific researcher doctor
Heather Browning has been studying

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.880
the sentience of octopuses for a
British government-commissioned report.

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.080
She shared the report findings
with Ruth

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.400
Alexander, presenter of BBC

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.560
Radio 4 programme,

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:04.120
The Food Chain.
So, we wanted to

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.040
look at whether they had
specific kinds of nerve connections

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.760
or if they had specific kinds of brains
and whether they were capable

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.800
of performing certain kinds of trade-off
behaviours or pain-related behaviours,

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.200
learning behaviours
that we thought would correlate

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.160
with the probability of sentience.

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.560
And what we found for octopuses in
particular is they seemed to meet many

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.080
of the criteria
that we'd laid out.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.000
The scientists found that octopuses do
experience feelings because they show

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.160
typical characteristics
of sentient creatures, such as trade-off

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.920
behaviour. Trade-off
means giving up one thing

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.560
in return for another, such
as giving up shelter for food.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.320
So, it looks like the debate about
whether it's OK to farm

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.040
and eat octopuses will continue.

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.240
OK, Beth. I think it's time
I revealed the answer to my question.

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.920
I asked you where Inky

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.360
the octopus went when he escaped his
tank at the New Zealand National Aquarium.

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.960
And I said it was
to the tank

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.160
of a female
octopus.

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.200
Well, that was the wrong answer,

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.920
I'm afraid.
In fact, Inky

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.160
the octopus was trying
to reach the tank of a female

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:21.240
but he found a drain instead, which
led straight to the Pacific Ocean.

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:23.320
OK, let's recap the vocabulary

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:26.400
we have learned from this programme,
starting with umami,

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.000
the flavour octopus has,
which can be described as savoury

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.920
and is one of the five basic tastes.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:34.320
If something is sentient,

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.760
it experiences

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:39.280
feelings such as joy and pain.
Life cycle

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.120
is the series of changes something
goes through from birth to death.

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:44.800
If something is solitary,

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.120
it likes to live alone.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:49.680
In captivity means
an animal is kept somewhere

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.480
and is not allowed to leave.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.200
And finally trade-off
means to exchange

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.320
one thing for another.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:58.600
Once again
our six minutes are up.

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.000
Join us again soon for more useful
vocabulary here at Six Minute

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.000
English. Goodbye for now.
Bye!
