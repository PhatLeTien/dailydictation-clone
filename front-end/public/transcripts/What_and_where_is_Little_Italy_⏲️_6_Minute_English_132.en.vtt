Hello. This is Six Minute

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.160
English from BBC
Learning English.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.480
I'm Neil. And I'm Georgie. Now,
if I told you

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.600
I'd been for a walk to see Big Ben
and Buckingham Palace,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.000
you'd know straight away
I was in London.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.680
But what if my walk went past
cafes selling mozzarella and ricotta,

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.200
where I smelled freshly
made canollis and focaccia...

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.400
Where would I be then?
Focaccia and mozzarella…

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.760
Well, you'd be in Italy. Right.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.360
Yes, Italy, or Little Italy, to be exact –
the neighbourhood in some cities

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.120
where Italian communities settled
and made their home.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.320
These Italian arrivals opened shops
and cafes selling food

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.000
to their own communities.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Soon dishes like spaghetti and meatballs
attracted the attention of local people

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.360
and gradually Italian food became famous
around the world. In this programme,

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.400
we will be taking a walk through
two Little Italy's, one in Argentina,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.880
the other in New York, and,

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.040
as usual, we'll be learning
some useful new vocabulary as well.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.040
But before that, I have a question
for you, Georgie.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.000
According to a recent YouGov poll,
which Italian food is most popular

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.720
with British diners? Is it a) pizza
b) lasagne or c) garlic bread?

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.840
I think it must be pizza.

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.040
OK, Georgie. I'll reveal the answer
at the end of the programme.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.520
One country
Italians moved to was Argentina.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.680
In 1898,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.680
Giuseppe Banchero arrived in
the neighbourhood of La Boca,

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.880
the Little Italy of Buenos Aires,

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.640
where many Italian immigrants
started restaurants. Here,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.960
Hugo Banchero, grandson of
Giuseppe, tells his story to

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.600
Veronica Smink, reporter for BBC

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.120
World Service Programme,
The Food Chain:

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:04.280
Well, my grandfather came from
Italy, from Genoa, from Liguria.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.520
He was born
in the centre of Genoa

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.360
and arrived here in
1898 at the age of

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.800
seven and a half, and this
pizzeria where we are

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.840
was founded on March 28, 1972.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.680
We have been here
for 91 years.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.280
So what culinary traditions

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.480
did they bring with them?
&nbsp;

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.600
Well, our

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.880
culinary tradition

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.440
is pizza,

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.440
and we incorporated the

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.040
fainâ from Genoa, which is a
pizza with chickpea flour…

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.400
In 1898,

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.080
Giuseppe founded his pizzeria –
a restaurant selling pizza. When

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.560
a business is founded, its established –
someone starts it up or sets it up.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.000
Giuseppe brought the culinary
traditions from his home in Liguria

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.080
in northern Italy, including regional
pizzas like fainâ and furgazzetta.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.240
The adjective culinary describes
anything connected with cooking.

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:06.680
But probably the best-known

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.600
Little Italy in the world is an area
of Manhattan's Lower East Side

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.320
in New York. 90% of Italian
immigrants who arrived in the US

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:16.880
at the turn of the century

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.640
came through this neighbourhood.
De Palos,

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.280
one of the original shops selling
Italian food in Little Italy,

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:27.760
has been serving customers
for 113 years. Here, Lou De

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:32.000
Palo, co-owner and great-grandson of
the original owner, Salvino,

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.200
explains more
about his family history to BBC

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.600
World Service Programme,
The Food Chain:

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.520
1925… when my grandmother, Concetta,

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.040
and my grandfather, Luigi,

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.480
got married, they
opened their own shop…

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.200
it's the shop we continue today
being the fourth generation working

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.760
alongside my sister, Maria, my
brother, Sal, and our children,

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.320
the fifth generation. Our business has
expanded; expanded to represent

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.960
the full food culture
of the 20 regions of Italy.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.880
Little Italy is the stepping stone
of the Italian immigrant.

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:11.360
This is where many of the Italian's
first came through Ellis Island,

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.440
and then settled here and then
eventually moved into mainstream America

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.360
and throughout the
rest of the country.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.920
Lou De Palo is the fourth generation

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.880
of his family to run the shop,

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:26.040
and his children will be
the fifth. Phrases like fourth

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.240
or fifth generation
describe the children

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.200
of people whose parents immigrated
to a particular country.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.800
After arriving in New York,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.360
many Italian immigrants moved on to
start successful new lives elsewhere.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:42.840
That's why Lou calls Little Italy
a stepping stone, an experience

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.560
that helps you achieve something else,
like a real stepping stone

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.160
helps you cross a river. As a result,

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.920
Italian newcomers became accepted
in mainstream America, mainstream

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.360
meaning the culture and customs
viewed as 'normal' by most Americans.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.760
It seems we owe a lot
to Little Italy.

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.080
But we still don't know which food is
most popular here in the UK. Isn't it

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.360
time to reveal the answer
to your question, Neil?

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:08.520
Right.
I asked you

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.600
which Italian food is most popular
in Britain

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:14.480
and you said pizza,
which would be my guess too,

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:16.280
but is... the wrong answer,

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.920
I'm afraid! In fact,

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:22.840
the top choice for Italian food fans
here in the UK is garlic bread.

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.680
Right, let's recap the vocabulary

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.800
we've learned from this programme
on Little Italy,

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:31.120
starting with pizzeria,
a restaurant that sells pizza.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.320
If something is founded, it's
started or established.

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.880
The adjective culinary describes
anything connected with cooking.

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.280
Phrases like fourth or fifth
generation describe the children

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.800
of people whose parents immigrated
to a particular country.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.680
A stepping stone is an event
or experience that helps you advance

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.560
or achieve something new.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:55.920
And finally, the adjective mainstream
describes the customs and culture

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.440
which are accepted as 'normal' by
most people in a society. Once again

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.560
our six minutes are up. Until
the next time here at 6 Minute

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.160
English, it's ciao!

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.360
Ciao!
