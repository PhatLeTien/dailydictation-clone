# Frontend Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the frontend of the project:

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system.

## Installation and Running

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:

   ```
   cd front-end
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```
   npm start
   ```

   This command will start the frontend application. Once it's running, you can usually access it by opening a web browser and going to `http://localhost:3000` (unless a different port is specified).

## Additional Information

- The `npm start` command typically runs the app in development mode.
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
- The page will reload if you make edits.
- You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Happy coding!
